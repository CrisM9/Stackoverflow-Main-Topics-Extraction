However I want there to be an additional row or control that always appears after the last data row.</p> <p>I can get the additional control to appear after the last row using a <code>ControlTemplate</code> and setting the RowsPresenter row to Auto height but this means the rows never scroll when the render area gets too small.

145025,WCF Service authorization patterns,<p>I'm implementing a secure WCF service. Authentication is done using username / password or Windows credentials. The service is hosted in a Windows Service process. Now I'm trying to find out the best way to implement <em>authorization</em> for each service operation.</p> <p>For example consider the following method:</p> <pre><code>public EntityInfo GetEntityInfo(string entityId); </code></pre> <p>As you may know in WCF there is an OperationContext object from which you can retrieve the security credentials passed in by the caller/client. Now<em>authentication</em> would have already finished by the time the first line in the method is called. However how do we implement authorization if the decision depends on the input data itself? For example in the above case say 'admin' users(whose permissions etc are stored in a database) are allowed to get entity info and other users should not be allowed... where do we put the authorization checks?</p> <p>Say we put it in the first line of the method like so:</p> <pre><code>CheckAccessPermission(PermissionType.GetEntity user entityId) //user is pulled from the current OperationContext </code></pre> <p>Now there are a couple of questions:</p> <ol> <li><p>Do we validate the entityId (for example check null / empty value etc) BEFORE the authorization check or INSIDE the authorization check? In other words if authorization checks should be included in every method is that a good pattern? Which should happen first - argument validation or authorization?</p></li> <li><p>How do we unit test a WCF service when authorization checks are all over the place like this and we don't have an OperationContext in the unit test!? (Assuming I'm tryin to test this service class implementation directly without any of the WCF setup).</p></li> </ol> <p>Any ideas guys?</p>,c#|.net|wcf|authorization

432603,Filesystem seek performance with lots of tiny files,<p>I'm looking to build a server with lots of tiny files delivered by an XML API. It won't be doing a whole lot of iterating over directories or blocks of sequential files--we're talking lots and lots of seeks for discontinuous data.</p> <p>Will seek time on BSD UFS degrade over time for requests for individual files? I understand that the filesystem's inode limit is based on the size of the partition/slice but the hard drive has to step through the inode table for every file request before it can discover the location of the data. What filesystem yields the best performance for seek time?</p> <p>The alternative is to setup 2-4GB blob files and have a separate system of seeking a file contained in them from within the software. The software's inode table could be optimized for delivery based on currently logged in user etc... These inode tables would likely be cached in RAM and would only relate to the users currently logged in so that there are fewer wasted resources.</p> <p>Where do these two solutions rate on a scalability and maintenance standpoint?

656098,ASP.net RequiredFieldValidator not preventing postback,<p>I have a question about what could stop a RequiredFieldValidator from preventing a postback.</p> <p>I began working on an older but simple aspx form and my predecessor used manual server-side form validation (checking to see if some form fields have a value and if not displaying an error message in a label). I thought I'd clean out some unneeded code and replace the manual checking with RequiredFieldValidator controls but while they appear to be validating they aren't preventing a postback. Ie. I get my error messages displayed but the postback still occurs. </p> <p>The form is quite simple and there are no CausesValidation= false attributes set. My controls look like:</p> <pre><code> &lt;asp:TextBox ID= txtPhone Runat= server Columns= 20 MaxLength= 20 /&gt; &lt;asp:RequiredFieldValidator ID= rfvPhone runat= server Display= Dynamic ErrorMessage= * Required ControlToValidate= txtPhone /&gt; </code></pre> <p>I created a brand new webform in the same project with just a single textbox validator and submit button and it acts the same way. Error message displays but postback still occurs.</p> <p>Is there a global or project-wide setting that would cause this behaviour? Something in the web.config or global.asax?</p>,asp.net|validation

344162,Set HTML element's style property in javascript,<p>I have a bunch of old classic ASP pages many of which show database data in tables. None of the pages have any sorting functionality built in: you are at the mercy of whatever ORDER BY clause the original developer saw fit to use.</p> <p>I'm working on a quick fix to tack on sorting via client-side javascript. I have a script already written that mostly does what I need. However I still need to add one bit of functionality. The table rows in these pages will often have alternating row colors and the mechanism used to achieve this varies among the pages. It might be as simple as changing a CSS class or the styles may have been rendered inline by the ASP code.</p> <p>Right now after sorting the table each row keeps the coloring scheme is was rendered with and so the alternating rows no longer alternate. I was hoping to fix it with something simple like this:</p> <pre><code>/* table is a var for the table element I'm sorting. I've already verified it exists and that there are at least three rows. At this point the first row (index 0) is always the header row. */ // check for alternating row styles: var RowStyle = table.rows[1].style; var AltStyle = table.rows[2].style; // SORT HAPPENS HERE!! // snip // Apply alternating row styles if (RowStyle === AltStyle) return true; for (var i=1il=table.rows.length;i&lt;il;i+=1) { if (i%2==0) table.rows[i].style=RowStyle; else table.rows[i].style=AltStyle; } </code></pre> <p>Unfortunately you can't just set to an element's style property like this. It complains that the object has no setter. How else can I do this simply? No frameworks like jQuery allowed here- that's out of my hands.</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong><br> While it would be the best solution it's just not practical to refactor 100+ pages to all use classes rather than inline style. Also sometimes there's more involved than just the background color. For example a row may be much darker or lighter than the alternating row with one style having a different foreground color as well to accommodate. Or an alternating style may set borders differently. I really don't know what is used on all of these pages so I need something that will generically apply <em>all</em> styles from one row to another.</p>,javascript|html|styles

It extends C# and Visual Basic with native language syntax for queries and provides class libraries to take advantage of these capabilities.</p> </blockquote> <p>What this means is that LINQ provides a standard way to query a variety of datasources using a common syntax. </p> <h2>What flavours of LINQ are there?</h2> <p>Currently there are a few different LINQ providers provided by Microsoft:</p> <ul> <li><a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397919.aspx >Linq to Objects</a> which allows you to execute queries on any IEnumerable object. </li> <li><a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb425822.aspx >Linq to SQL</a> which allows you to execute queries against a database in an object oriented manner. </li> <li><a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb387098.aspx >Linq to XML</a> which allows you to query load validate serialize and manipulate XML documents.</li> <li><a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386964.aspx >Linq to Entities</a> as suggested by <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16322/all-about-linq#33588 >Andrei</a></li> <li><a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb399399.aspx >Linq to Dataset</a></li> </ul> <p>There are quite a few others many of which are listed <a href= http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/vardi/archive/2008/10/09/the-linq-list-projects.aspx >here</a>.</p> <h2>What are the benefits?</h2> <ul> <li>Standardized way to query multiple datasources</li> <li>Compile time safety of queries</li> <li>Optimized way to perform set based operations on in memory objects</li> <li>Ability to debug queries</li> </ul> <h2>So what can I do with LINQ?</h2> <p><a href= http://stackoverflow.com/users/489/ch00k >Chook</a> provides a way to <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4432/csv-string-handling#4441 >output CSV files</a><br> <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/users/1/jeff-atwood >Jeff</a> shows how to <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9673/remove-duplicates-from-array#9685 >remove duplicates from an array</a><br> Bob gets a <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/59/how-do-i-get-a-distinct-ordered-list-of-names-from-a-datatable-using-linq#62 >distinct ordered list from a datatable</a><br> <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/users/1659/marxidad >Marxidad</a> shows how to <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15486/sorting-an-ilist-in-c#15495 >sort an array</a><br> Dana gets help implementing a <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/185072/learning-linq-quicksort >Quick Sort Using Linq</a> </p> <h2>Where to start?</h2> <p><strong>A summary of links from <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8050/beginners-guide-to-linq >GateKiller's question</a> are below</strong>:<br> Scott Guthrie provides an <a href= http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/05/19/using-linq-to-sql-part-1.aspx >intro to Linq on his blog</a><br> An overview of <a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb308959.aspx >LINQ on MSDN</a> </p> <p><strong><a href= http://stackoverflow.com/users/1758/ChrisAnnODell >ChrisAnnODell</a> suggests checking out:</strong> </p> <ul> <li><a href= http://www.hookedonlinq.com/MainPage.ashx >Hooked on Linq</a> </li> <li><a href= http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/101-LINQ-Samples-3fb9811b >101 Linq Samples</a></li> <li><a href= http://www.linqpad.net/ >LinqPad</a> </li> </ul> <h2>What do I need to use LINQ?</h2> <p>Linq is currently available in VB.Net 9.0 and C# 3.0 so you'll need Visual Studio 2008 or greater to get the full benefits.

402217,How to store a dictionary on a Django Model?,<p>I need to store some data in a Django model. These data are not equal to all instances of the model.</p> <p>At first I thought about subclassing the model but I’m trying to keep the application flexible. If I use subclasses I’ll need to create a whole class each time I need a new kind of object and that’s no good. I’ll also end up with a lot of subclasses only to store a pair of extra fields.</p> <p>I really feel that a dictionary would be the best approach but there’s nothing in the Django documentation about storing a dictionary in a Django model (or I can’t find it).</p> <p>Any clues?</p>,python|django|orm|persistence
129693,Is duplicated code more tolerable in unit tests?,<p>I ruined several unit tests some time ago when I went through and refactored them to make them more <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself >DRY</a>--the intent of each test was no longer clear. It seems there is a trade-off between tests' readability and maintainability. If I leave duplicated code in unit tests they're more readable but then if I change the <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Under_Test >SUT</a> I'll have to track down and change each copy of the duplicated code.</p> <p>Do you agree that this trade-off exists? If so do you prefer your tests to be readable or maintainable?</p>,unit-testing|dry|code-duplication

477572,Strange out of memory issue while loading an image to a Bitmap object,<p>I have a list view with a couple of image buttons on each row. When you click the list row it launches a new activity. I have had to build my own tabs because of an issue with the camera layout. The activity that gets launched for result is a map. If I click on my button to launch the image preview (load an image off the SD card) the application returns from the activity back to the <code>listview</code> activity to the result handler to relaunch my new activity which is nothing more than an image widget. </p> <p>The image preview on the list view is being done with the cursor and <code>ListAdapter</code>. This makes it pretty simple but I am not sure how I can put a resized image (I.e. Smaller bit size not pixel as the <code>src</code> for the image button on the fly. So I just resized the image that came off the phone camera.</p> <p>The issue is that I get an out of memory error when it tries to go back and re-launch the 2nd activity.</p> <ul> <li>Is there a way I can build the list adapter easily row by row where I can resize on the fly (<em>bit wise</em>)? </li> </ul> <p>This would be preferable as I also need to make some changes to the properties of the widgets/elements in each row as I am unable to select a row with touch screen because of focus issue. (<em>I can use roller ball.</em>)</p> <ul> <li>I know I can do an out of band resize and save of my image but that is not really what I want to do but some sample code for that would be nice.</li> </ul> <p>As soon as I disabled the image on the list view it worked fine again.</p> <p>FYI: This is how I was doing it:</p> <pre><code>String[] from = new String[] { DBHelper.KEY_BUSINESSNAMEDBHelper.KEY_ADDRESSDBHelper.KEY_CITYDBHelper.KEY_GPSLONGDBHelper.KEY_GPSLATDBHelper.KEY_IMAGEFILENAME + }; int[] to = new int[] {R.id.businessnameR.id.addressR.id.cityR.id.gpslongR.id.gpslatR.id.imagefilename }; notes = new SimpleCursorAdapter(this R.layout.notes_row c from to); setListAdapter(notes); </code></pre> <p>Where <code>R.id.imagefilename</code> is a <code>ButtonImage</code>.</p> <p>Here is my LogCat:</p> <blockquote> <p>---------- 01-25 05:05:49.877: ERROR/dalvikvm-heap(3896): 6291456-byte external allocation

18418125,Java Brickbreaker paddle collision detection,<p>I am trying to make a brickbreaker game and I have run into some issues when it comes to collision detection. If you have ever played brick breaker you know that on the paddle if the ball is moving to the left and you hit the left side of the top then it continues moving right. Although if you hit it on the right side in this case then the ball changes directions. And also if you hit it on the sides of the paddle it bounces off on the Y axis. Since I have no idea how to do the top part of the paddle I can't show you the code because I don't have any :) This is the code that I am using for the sides:</p> <pre><code>Rectangle rect1 = new Rectangle((int) paddleDir 570 imsLoader.getImage( paddle1 ).getWidth() imsLoader.getImage( paddle1 ).getHeight()); Rectangle rect2 = new Rectangle((int) ballX (int) ballY imsLoader.getImage( ball ).getWidth() imsLoader.getImage( ball ).getHeight()); if (rect1.intersects(rect2)) { if (rect1.x == rect2.getMaxX() || rect1.getMaxX() == rect2.x) { ballVX = -ballVX; clipsLoader.play( pattleHit  false); } else { ballVY = -ballVY; ballY += 0.05; clipsLoader.play( pattleHit  false); } } </code></pre> <p>What happens is that the ball when gets hit on the side just goes right through the paddle going all over the place and when it reaches the other end either goes up or down!</p>,java|collision-detection|java-2d
490329,ObjectDataSource caching on large static result set,<p>I have an objectdatasource that will return a potentially large collection (up to 200000 records) that are bound and paged in a gridview. I am using default paging and caching on the objectdatasource. The data being returned is only updated weekly so stale data is not an issue. The paging in this solution was also faster than when I created a solution using custom paging. </p> <p>My questions are: Is caching a record set this large acceptable to you? If not why? Are there any performance counters that you use to see the impact on memory that your cached data is creating?</p> <p>Thanks! </p>,asp.net|caching|objectdatasource|performancecounter

36609365,How to model a mixture of finite components from different parametric families with JAGS?,<p>Imagine a underlying process that draws a number from a normal distribution with probability $\alpha$ and from a uniform distribution with probability $1 - \alpha$. The observed sequence of numbers generated by this process therefore follows a distribution $f$ that is a <strong>mixture</strong> of 2 <strong>components</strong> and <strong>mixing weights</strong> of $\alpha$ and $1 - \alpha$. How would you model this kind of mixture with JAGS when the observed sequence is the only input but the parametric families are known?</p> <p>Example (in R):</p> <pre><code>set.seed(8361299) N &lt;- 100 alpha &lt;- 0.3 mu &lt;- 5 max &lt;- 50 # Which component to choose from? latent_class &lt;- rbinom(N 1 alpha) Y &lt;- ifelse(latent_class runif(N min=mu max=max) rnorm(N mean=mu)) </code></pre> <p>The generated (observed) Y looks like: <a href= http://i.stack.imgur.com/FUKaj.png rel= nofollow ><img src= http://i.stack.imgur.com/FUKaj.png alt= Generated Y ></a></p> <p>With JAGS it should be possible to obtain the mixing weights as well as the parameters of the known components?</p>,r|jags

508000,Is it possible to refresh a CSS sheet with an AJAX postback?,<p>I have been learning how to create dynamic images and dynamic stylesheets using ASP.NET 3.5. My reasoning behind this is I have a web page that I want to change the header background image (set with css) automatically. Check below for my test script:</p> <p><hr /></p> <pre><code>&lt;%@ Page Language= VB AutoEventWireup= false CodeFile= Default.aspx.vb Inherits= _Default %&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC -//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd &gt; &lt;html xmlns= http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml &gt; &lt;head runat= server &gt; &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; &lt;% Response.Output.WriteLine( &lt;link rel= Stylesheet type= text/css href= style.aspx?t={0}&amp;v={1} /&gt;  oType oText) %&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;form id= form1 runat= server action= Default.aspx &gt; &lt;asp:ScriptManager ID= ScriptManager1 runat= server /&gt; &lt;asp:UpdatePanel ID= UpdatePanel1 runat= server &gt; &lt;ContentTemplate&gt; &lt;div class= testheader &gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;asp:Label ID= Label1 runat= server Text= Label &gt;&lt;/asp:Label&gt; &lt;%-- for testing --%&gt; &lt;/ContentTemplate&gt; &lt;Triggers&gt; &lt;asp:AsyncPostBackTrigger ControlID= Button1 EventName= Click /&gt; &lt;/Triggers&gt; &lt;/asp:UpdatePanel&gt; &lt;asp:Button ID= Button1 runat= server Text= Button /&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre> <p>So nothing special about the default form page above it has an DIV styled to have the dynamic background image and a Label which as the comment indicates is just to make sure my AsyncPostBack is functioning properly.</p> <pre><code>Partial Class _Default Inherits System.Web.UI.Page Public oType As String = m Public oText As String = Genius on the Web Protected Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As Object ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Select Case oType Case m oType = c Case c oType = m End Select Label1.Text = Now.ToString End Sub End Class </code></pre> <p>Again nothing fancy. Just swaps the two values I have temporarily hard-coded into the program and updates the Label text.</p> <p>This is my dynamic stylesheet:</p> <pre><code>&lt;%@ Page Language= VB %&gt; &lt;% Response.ContentType = text/css Dim qString As String = Request.QueryString( t ) Dim bText As String = Request.QueryString( v ) If String.IsNullOrEmpty(qString) Then qString = blank If String.IsNullOrEmpty(bText) Then bText = Placeholder Dim theColor H1size bannerImg As String Select Case qString Case c theColor = green H1size = 30 Case m theColor = blue H1size = 26 Case Else theColor = red End Select bannerImg = String.Format( image.aspx?t={0}&amp;p={1}  Server.UrlEncode(bText) qString) %&gt; body { background-color: &lt;%=theColor%&gt;; } .testheader { background: url(&lt;%=bannerImg%&gt;); background-repeat:no-repeat; height:120px; } .testclass { font-size: &lt;%=H1size%&gt;px; border:1px solid yellow; margin-bottom:2em; } </code></pre> <p>Finally here is my dynamic image script:</p> <pre><code>Protected Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As Object ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Load Response.ContentType = image/jpeg Response.Clear() Response.BufferOutput = True Try Dim oText As String = Server.HtmlDecode(Request.QueryString( t )) If String.IsNullOrEmpty(oText) Then oText = Placeholder Dim oPType As String = Server.HtmlDecode(Request.QueryString( p )) If String.IsNullOrEmpty(oPType) Then oPType = none Dim imgPath As String = Select Case oPType Case c imgPath = img/banner_green.jpg Case m imgPath = img/banner_blue.jpg Case Else Throw New Exception( no ptype ) End Select Dim oBitmap As Bitmap = New Bitmap(Server.MapPath(imgPath)) Dim oGraphic As Graphics = Graphics.FromImage(oBitmap) Dim frontColorBrush As New SolidBrush(Color.White) Dim oFont As New Font(FONT_NAME 30) Dim oInfo() As ImageCodecInfo = ImageCodecInfo.GetImageEncoders Dim oEncoderParams As New EncoderParameters(1) 'jpeg Dim xOffset As Single = Math.Round((oBitmap.Height - oFont.Height) / 2 MidpointRounding.ToEven) Dim oPoint As New PointF(275.0F xOffset + 10) oEncoderParams.Param(0) = New EncoderParameter(Encoder.Quality 100L) oGraphic.TextRenderingHint = Drawing.Text.TextRenderingHint.AntiAlias oGraphic.DrawString(oText oFont frontColorBrush oPoint) oBitmap.Save(Response.OutputStream oInfo(1) oEncoderParams) Response.Output.Write(oBitmap) oBitmap.Dispose() oGraphic.Dispose() Response.Flush() Catch ex As Exception End Try End Sub </code></pre> <p><hr /></p> <p>So armed with this information I want to know if it is possible for the AsyncPostBack refresh the CSS so that the image will change when I click Button2. I am open for suggestions and/or thats the stupid/hard way to do this try this... type of feedback.</p> <p>Thanks guys!</p>,vb.net|asp.net-ajax|asp.net-3.5|dynamic-css
23586512,Grails project in eclipse under git won't run from the grails run-app command,<p>I have a grails project under Eclipse that runs fine from the right click -> run as -> grails run-app option. However when I move the project under git control using the Eclipse Egit plugin it won't run as such anymore. Grails complains that the project in the directory doesn't appear to be a grails application. I think what is going on here is that when I place the project under git control using Egit git moves it under its own repository that it makes you create and the project isn't in the Eclipse workspace anymore I confirmed this by navigation under windows to my Eclipse project workspace directory. Instead git just leaves a symbolic link or something to the project in the eclipse workspace which is why the project continues to show up in the project workspace in eclipse. Since after moving it under git I can't get it to run using the right click -> run as -> grails run-app on the project followed by grails run-app  what I do is open up a command prompt and navigate to the directory where the project really is (under git's repository and then into the project directory) and then type grails run-app and it runs fine. Anyway to solve this so that I can continue to run from the project right click menu even after the project is under git control? That way I can have version control as well as preserve my right-click to run the project option? Fyi I am just doing local git no github.</p> <p>Thank you</p>,eclipse|git|grails

The problem is that in the last step the Clicked event isn't firing for the button and the server side event handler never gets called. </p> <p>Here is the relevant .aspx code:</p> <pre><code>&lt;script type= text/javascript language= javascript &gt; var spellCheckFinished = false; var btnClicked; function doSpellCheckStuff(btnTrigger) { btnClicked = btnTrigger; var spell = GetRadSpell('&lt;%= rsMessage.ClientID %&gt;'); // spell.add_clientCheckFinished(checkFinished); spell.startSpellCheck(); return false; } function checkFinished(sender args) { args.SuppressCompleteMessage = true; setTimeout('MySubmit();' 100); } function MySubmit() { WebForm_DoPostBackWithOptions( new WebForm_PostBackOptions(btnClicked.id '' true '' '' false true) ); } &lt;/script&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;asp:Button ID= btnSubmit OnClientClick= return doSpellCheckStuff(this); Text= Submit OnClick= btnSubmit_Click runat= server /&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;telerik:RadSpell ID= rsMessage ControlToCheck= txtMessage ButtonType= None UseClassicDialogs= true FragmentIgnoreOptions= All OnClientCheckFinished= checkFinished runat= server /&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; </code></pre> <p>Any idea why btnSubmit_Click isn't getting called and how I can fix it?</p>,asp.net|javascript|telerik
681942,UpdatePanel rerenders form,<p>I have a ascx that looks like this:</p> <pre><code>&lt;UpdatePanel Parent mode = Conditional&gt; &lt;UpdatePanel1 mode = Conditional&gt; //A form here with textboxes etc //A repeater here with a linkbutton that causes a postback &lt;/UpdatePanel1&gt; &lt;/UpdatePanel Parent&gt; </code></pre> <p>In the OnItemCommand of the repeater I get the form values and set them. It works fine but there is re-rendering of the form (ie. a flicker during which the form disappears and reappears). Why is this happening considering i have it in an UpdatePanel?</p> <p><strong>EDIT: I seem to have half solved the problem by separating the form and the repeater into its different updatepanels. But the problem now is that the form doesnt get updated when I click on the linkbutton in the repeater even though the server side code runs.</strong></p> <p>EDIT AGAIN:</p> <p>I think I know what's going on. I have 1 question before nailing this (hopefully). The form looks like this:</p> <pre><code>&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;asp:checkbox id= chkSelect runat= server /&gt; &lt;asp:label text= Something runat= server /&gt; &lt;asp:textbox id= txtSomething runat= server /&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;asp:checkbox id= chkSelect2 runat= server /&gt; &lt;asp:label text= Something2 runat= server /&gt; &lt;asp:textbox id= txtSomething2 runat= server /&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; </code></pre> <p>All I care about when the linkbutton is clicked is to update ONLY the textbox controls. I want everything else to remain the way they were.</p> <p>Is there a way to conditionally trigger updates only on those controls?</p> <p>I understand I can use JS but would rather avoid it (as there's a lot of server side processing before I know the values of the textboxes)</p> <p><strong><em>@Roselberg - The state of the controls that I am NOT interested in is actually set on the client side in one huge JS script that runs on load to which I really don't have much control over the script</em></strong></p>,c#|asp.net

The way I'm doing it is I'm first converting it to <code>COLOR_BGR2HLS_FULL</code> taking the green channel and applying GuassianBlur to it like so and then I'm using <code>THRESH_OTSU</code> to obtain the thresholded image and then drawing the contour:</p> <pre><code>self.result = cv2.cvtColor(self.result_array_color cv2.COLOR_BGR2HLS_FULL) self.result = self.result[::1] self.result = cv2.GaussianBlur(self.result(2525) 0) </code></pre> <p>Here's what the obtained image looks like:</p> <p><a href= http://i.stack.imgur.com/8f0tt.jpg rel= nofollow ><img src= http://i.stack.imgur.com/8f0tt.jpg alt= enter image description here ></a></p> <p>And here's what the desired image should look like:</p> <p><a href= http://i.stack.imgur.com/pmAg6.jpg rel= nofollow ><img src= http://i.stack.imgur.com/pmAg6.jpg alt= enter image description here ></a></p> <p>Also my way of going about this isn't consistent with all the images of similar type.

This might sound strange so here's the code with the line in question commented:</p> <pre><code>def depthFirst(node soughtValue visitedNodes): if node.value == soughtValue: return True visitedNodes.add(node) for adjNode in node.adjacentNodes: if adjNode not in visitedNodes: if depthFirst(adjNode soughtValue visitedNodes): # why this? return True return False </code></pre> <p>My question: would replacing:</p> <pre><code>if depthFirst(adjNode soughtValue visitedNodes): return True </code></pre> <p>with</p> <pre><code>return depthFirst(adjNode soughtValue visitedNodes): </code></pre> <p>cut the search short by evaluating to <code>False</code> prematurely? The lines in question seems to be saying follow the current <code>adjNode</code> and see if it leads to a solution; if it does we'll get a series of <code>True</code> statements returned all the way to the beginning of the search (our current <code>adjNode</code>) from the leaf; this happens all the way to the root (the start of our search and the first recursive call). Only then we can say we've found a valid path and return 'True'. </p> <p>It seems as though the first return statement triggers the chain of 'True' statements and we leave the search inside the loop. Am I correct? There's a lot going on and any further explanation would be greatly appreciated. </p>,python|algorithm|recursion|depth-first-search

259461,Method to Serialize Objects from appserver to web server without code duplication,<p>I have a web-app-database 3 tier server setup. Web requests data from app and app gets its data from the db then processes and returns it to web for display. Standard. </p> <p>Currently all the data I serialize from app to web gets put into custom defined data structs that the web side then parses for display. In other words say I have an order that I want to retrieve and send to web. I don't serialize the whole object but rather build an array with the appropriate data elements while on the app server then serialize that array over to the web servers. </p> <p>Now I am looking into serializing the entire order object over to the web server.</p> <p>What is the best method you guys have found to serialize objects while maintaining separation of appserver and webserver code? I don't want my webservers having any code which accesses the DB but I want them to reuse the classes that encapsulate my order and other data as much as possible.</p> <p>To further refine my question (thanks to Glenn's response) I don't want my webservers to have any of the business logic around say the order class either that only the appserver needs to know. The objects already use separate serialization to/from the database and to/from the webservers. </p> <p>Using the order example on the appserver an order should be able to cancel: ie</p> <p>$order->cancel();</p> <p>but on the webserver that method should not even be found. It shouldn't simply proxy back (directly) to the appserver order's cancel method because user action requests should flow through the application's authorization and permissions checking layer.</p> <p>So how do I get an order object on my webserver that has some (but not all) of the methods and properties of the object on my appserver with little to no code duplication. One thing I've been thinking is to create a base class with a limited set of properties and methods. It would use an inner class to hold its properties and I would require all data access to pass in and out of getters and setters. These would in turn call the getters and setters on the inner class.</p> <p>The web and app servers could then independently extend the base class and use a custom inner class to hold the properties. Then on the app side for instance the inner class could be an ORM class extention that can persist data to the DB and on the web side the inner class could be a simple properties holder class.</p> <p>But the whole inner class thing seems a little clunky so I'm still looking for better solutions.</p>,php|serialization
324488,Programmatic Creation of a Notes Link Hotspot (URL),<p>Earlier versions of the Notes client would automatically turn a <em>sent</em> URL into a clickable link for the recipient (regardless of mail client) but with 6.5 (and presumably later) this no longer happens; that is the URL is sent as plain text.

I need their to be UDP interactions since the UDP protocol allows the loss of packets which is essential for an online game that has position and other updates being transferred that wouldn't be beneficial to resend if an error occurs. My problem occurred when I tried converting my client and server to the UDP protocol. In java I have noticed that it will be harder to create a UDP connection because it isn't as easy as binding to a port and awaiting connections IMHO so:</p> <ul> <li><p>Is it possible via the UDP protocol or any other protocol to have my server <em>broadcast</em> data such as entity location and allow the client to receive the data without having to pragmatically establish a permanent connection to that server.</p></li> <li><p>If the above is a no is it possible to use the UDP and TCP/IP protocols together without having to establish two separate connection.</p></li> </ul>,sockets|networking|tcp|udp

282332,java web app decorating/includes issues,<p>Background: we have a system that was written in an older CMS based on Java back during the 2002-2003 days. We want to keep moving forward with our new stuff using tomcat stripes and sitemesh. We have navigation layouts pods  js css etc that we've taken out of the old CMS and into a few of our new apps so we have consistent look and feel.</p> <p>We now need some sort of solution to get rid of all the code duplication going on. Our apps are running on the same VM at the moment but that might change. We need a way for all of our tomcat instances to access some common elements (and those elements may/may not need to do some server side stuff). </p> <p>The best we've come up with so far is making a fairly standard sitemesh decorator that uses c:import to get what it needs and plugs it right in. This solution has some network overhead which could bog it down and introduce a fail point. We've looked at &lt;%@ include file= /something.jsp %> as well but that seems to be only context relative. We could use c:import and point it at localhost which seems to be the best solution so far. </p> <p>Are there other templating/decorating frameworks out there (Tiles?) that could make this simpler? What are we missing?</p>,java|jsp|java-ee|stripes|sitemesh
178228,Best Practices : Where to place required files,<p>I'm working with a number of 'helper' classes which affectively have a bunch of static functions which allow the controllers and actions have access to chunks of shared functionality.</p> <p>Problem is that these files have been used as a dumping ground for any functionality which is required across the modules/application and as a result they are > 3k lines in size and at the top they've got about 50 <code>require_once</code> declarations!</p> <p>Obviously if a view in the application wan't to use a small part of the functionality available from these helpers it inherits all the required files and you end up bloating your app.</p> <p>If I were to include the files on a per need basis I could end up making numerous <code>require_once</code> calls to the required files which has it's own overhead (compounded with frequency) when I need use a large amount of the functionality available from these helper files.</p> <p>So essentially my question is where is the balance struck and is there a best practice that one can employ?</p> <p>Thanks</p> <p>Flunga</p>,php|coding-style

14616163,How to obtain the nth random nextInt value?,<p>When using class java.util.Random how can one get the value obtained from calling the method nextInt() N times but in a much more efficient way (in O(1) specifically)?</p> <p>For example if I construct a Random object with a particular seed value and I want to get the 100000th nextInt() value (that is the value obtained after calling the method nextInt() 100000 times) in a fast way could I do it?</p> <p>Assume for simplicity version 1.7.06 of the JDK since it may be required to know the exact values of some private fields in class Random. And speaking of I found the following fields to be relevant in the calculation of a random value:</p> <pre><code>private static final long multiplier = 0x5DEECE66DL; private static final long addend = 0xBL; private static final long mask = (1L &lt;&lt; 48) - 1; </code></pre> <p>After exploring a bit about randomness I found that random values are obtained using a <em>Linear congruential generator</em>. The actual method that executes the algorithm is method next(int):</p> <pre><code>protected int next(int bits) { long oldseed nextseed; AtomicLong seed = this.seed; do { oldseed = seed.get(); nextseed = (oldseed * multiplier + addend) &amp; mask; } while (!seed.compareAndSet(oldseed nextseed)); return (int)(nextseed &gt;&gt;&gt; (48 - bits)); } </code></pre> <p>The relevant line for the algorithm is the one that obtains the next seed value:</p> <pre><code>nextseed = (oldseed * multiplier + addend) &amp; mask; </code></pre> <p>So to be more specific is there a way that I can generalize this formula to obtain the nth nextseed value? I'm assuming here that after having that I can then simply obtain the nth int value by letting the variable bits be 32 (the method nextInt() simply calls next(32) and returns the result).</p> <p>Thanks in advance</p> <p>PS: Perhaps this is a question more suitable for <a href= http://math.stackexchange.com/ >mathexchange</a>?</p>,java|random

28719754,Unable to delete dynamically generated ImageView - Android,<p>I've got a list of images in my database table. When loading the activity I read the path of images from the file and create image view instances programatically and add one after the other to my linear layout container. Then for every imageView when clicked - I open my custom image editing activity and edit it. Once the image is edited and save it in a new file and I delete the old file path in the database. Then it comes back to the image view activity and adds the newly saved image to the container. Since I don't have the control of the imageViews in the container I'm not able to remove the imageView (file before editing) when it comes back to the view activity. But when I quit the application and load it again it looks into the database and loads the images and everything looks fine.

542328,DateTimePicker control usage in specific scenario,<p>This question is relating to a specific functionality that a client has requested for an application I am designing. Basically the client wants the DateTimePicker to prompt a question after the date was selected.</p> <p>This sounds simple however I am having difficulties accomplishing this simple task. </p> <ol> <li><strong>If I prompt OnCloseUp</strong> - Keyboard entries will not execute this event</li> <li><strong>If I prompt OnValueChanged</strong> - Event fires every time the date is changed</li> <li><strong>If I prompt OnLeave</strong> - Event fires somewhat. Does not fire when toolstrip is clicked for example. I would like to avoid this method as it only fires once the user clicks away from the control.</li> </ol> <p>So basically I am trying to think of the best way to prompt a user AFTER they select a date from a dateTimePicker control. </p> <p>I have no issues with building a custom control either.

13326979,Initial clause of loop need to reference a variable before it is declared,<p>Sorry for convoluted title I tried my best to make it conscious. Well if you have a better idea change it!</p> <p>Not to confuse you this is <em>Emacs</em> Lisp <code>loop</code> not Common Lisp:</p> <pre><code>(defun hxswfml-build-trie (alist) Builds a trie (a list containing number of hash-maps each hash-map uses single character for a key except for `t' symbol which if present as a key is the key for the value one has to substitute with. (loop for (key . value) in alist with trie = (make-hash-table) do (loop for c across key with branch = (or (gethash c trie) (puthash c (make-hash-table) trie)) with first-time = t do (if first-time (setq first-time nil) (setq branch (or (gethash c branch) (puthash c (make-hash-table) branch)))) finally (puthash t value branch)) finally (return trie))) </code></pre> <p>This transforms an alist into a tree made of hash tables where each table contains keys which are characters of the strings I'd later search for and replace. This is needed to optimize searching for multiple keys with possibly similar prefix in the large body of text and then replacing them each with a corresponding key.</p> <p>The problem is that in the inner loop I'd want to initialize <code>branch</code> to <code>trie</code> and then in all later iterations to set it to either new hash-table (created for the character not a part of a known prefix yet) or a hash-table which was already created for the character from the prefix.</p> <p>Ideally it would looks something like: </p> <pre><code>for branch = (or (and branch (gethash c branch)) (puthash c (make-hash-table) trie)) ;; ^-----------------^------- cannot reference it here </code></pre> <p>And that's why I have the silly <code>first-time</code> flag which I could've avoided. Can I somehow use <code>initially</code> form or maybe restructure the function in some other way to avoid this flag and the extra <code>if</code> with it? It's not very important that this function be fast (the searching should be fast but the building of the tree needs not) but it just looks ugly :)</p>,emacs|lisp|elisp

310376,Unordered lists and accessibility,<p>Many (most?) sites aiming for accessibility and standards compliance use unordered lists for their navigation. Does this make the site more accessible or does it just provide useful elements for styling?</p> <p>I don't mind them and I have been using unordered lists in this way. It's just that when I remove the styling from a page to try to gauge it's accessibility it strikes me that it could just as well could be plain links.

161556,Convert IDictionary<string string> keys to lowercase (C#),<p>I've got a Method that gets a IDictionary as a parameter. Now I want to provide a method that retrieves the value from this dictionary but it should be case-invariant.</p> <p>So my solution to this right now was to have a static function that loops through the keys and converts them toLower() like this:</p> <pre><code>private static IDictionary&lt;ILanguage IDictionary&lt;string string&gt;&gt; ConvertKeysToLowerCase( IDictionary&lt;ILanguage IDictionary&lt;string string&gt;&gt; dictionaries) { IDictionary&lt;ILanguage IDictionary&lt;string string&gt;&gt; resultingConvertedDictionaries = new Dictionary&lt;ILanguage IDictionary&lt;string string&gt;&gt;(); foreach(ILanguage keyLanguage in dictionaries.Keys) { IDictionary&lt;string string&gt; convertedDictionatry = new Dictionary&lt;string string&gt;(); foreach(string key in dictionaries[keyLanguage].Keys) { convertedDictionatry.Add(key.ToLower() dictionaries[keyLanguage][key]); } resultingConvertedDictionaries.Add(keyLanguage convertedDictionatry); } return resultingConvertedDictionaries; } </code></pre> <p>Now this is ok but still it's a pretty huge chunk of code that contradicts my idea of clean and efficient . Do you know any alternatives to this so that the .ContainsKey() method of the dictionary doesn't differentiate between casing?</p>,c#|.net|idictionary

However I also need the default ShortDate pattern in some situations so changing that would unfortunately leave me with another equivalent problem.</p> <p>Final edit: in case anyone cares.

I've got a ComboBox to use a DataTemplate that makes the dropdown look like the dropdown for the AwesomeBar but I'm not sure how to get the right behaviour.</p> <p>What I want to happen is for the user to type their search into the TextBox bit of the ComboBox and then to gradually narrow down the results in the dropdown. I think I can probably get the database querying part of that working (as the results will be coming from the database) but what I want to get is the dropdown bit to open up as soon as the user starts typing (as it does in firefox 3) and then the first item in the list to be automatically selected and other items in the list to be able to be selected by use of the arrow keys or by clicking on them.</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong></p> <p>I've now found the programmatic way to get the ComboBox to drop down (using IsDropDownOpen = true) but I still have a few other problems:</p> <p>Firstly when I type something it drops down but it doesn't select the match closest to what I'm typing and secondly when I type something which uniquely selects an item it automatically closes and runs the SelectedItemChanged method. I want it to only close and run the code when I've actually clicked on it or pressed enter (rather than just had the selection on it by using the up or down arrows). Any ideas how to get it to do what I want? I can give more information if that's not clear enough.</p>,c#|.net|wpf|combobox

578954,Dynamically Created User Controls In C#,<p>I am working in a C# winforms project and I have a user control which gets loaded upon its selection from a tool-strip menu. I have a dictionary lookup set to occur upon form load of the user control for other functionality. Also when I close the user control I am just using the .Hide(); method. I noticed that when I load the user control the first time everything is fine but when I close it and choose to open it again the 2nd time it creates a new instance of the object thus throwing off my dictionary lookup. Therefore I wrote some code in an attempt to fix the issue. </p> <p>What I need to do is to somehow say that if an instance of the user control already exists do not create a new instance of that object. Instead just make the user control visible again. Therefore I have written code in an attempt to accomplish this purpose. When I select the item the first time everything is fine. When I hide the user control and try to re-open it again nothing happens.</p> <p>The following is the code I have written for this purpose which occurs upon the selection of the item from the tool-strip menu:</p> <pre><code> if (Controls.ContainsKey( CheckAvailUserControl )) { Controls[ CheckAvailUserControl ].Dock = DockStyle.Fill; Controls[ CheckAvailUserControl ].Visible = true; Controls[ CheckAvailUserControl ].Show(); Controls[ CheckAvailUserControl ].Refresh(); } else { UserControl checkAvailUserControlLoad = new CheckAvailUserControl(); Controls.Add(checkAvailUserControlLoad); checkAvailUserControlLoad.Dock = DockStyle.Fill; checkAvailUserControlLoad.Visible = true; checkAvailUserControlLoad.Show(); } </code></pre> <p>When I trace through my code in the debugger it is in fact hitting the right parts of the above if/else statement. Its just not displaying the user control on the screen the 2nd time I attempt to load it.</p> <p>The question is: How do I get the user control to load correctly after I close it then select it from the tool-strip menu again?</p>,c#|.net|winforms|dynamic-controls

389180,assert and NDEBUG,<p>After reading some threads on misuses of exceptions (basically saying you don't want to unwind the stack if a functions preconditions are incorrect - possibly signalling that all your memory is corrupt or something equally dangerous) I'm thinking about using assert() more often. Previously I have only used assert() as a debug tool and I think this is how a lot of C++ programmers use it. I'm concerned about part of my error handling being turned off by a NDEBUG #define introduced to the runtime builds at some point in the future. Is there a way round this and have others had a problem with this (i.e. should I be worrying about it)?</p> <p>Thanks Pat</p> <p>Edit: The point of the threads I was reading was that if your application is truely buggered then unwinding stack could damage the system for instance if a destructor wrote something to a file and the file handle was corrupted. I'm not suggesting using assert for normal error handling. The current use case I have is pretty weak but see what you think:</p> <pre> <code> //check later code won't crash the system if( buf.length() % 2 ) return false; // do other stuff that shouldn't affect bufs length //copy 2 bytes into buf at a time if length is odd then don't know //what will happen so use assert to make sure it can't damage anything assert( !(buf.length() % 2) ); for( i = 0; i != buf.length(); i += 2 ) memcpy( buf + i data 2 ); </code> </pre> <p>edit2: the discussion is here: <a href= http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.c++.moderated/browse_frm/thread/80083ac31a1188da rel= nofollow >http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.c++.moderated/browse_frm/thread/80083ac31a1188da</a></p>,c++|error-handling

315363,Spambots are cluttering my log file [Django],<p>I have a nice and lovely Django site up and running but have noticed that my <code>error.log</code> file was getting huge over 150 MB after a couple of months of being live. Turns out a bunch of spambots are looking for well known URL vulnerabilities (or something) and hitting a bunch of sub-directories like <code>http://mysite.com/ie</code> or <code>http://mysite.com/~admin.php</code> etc. </p> <p>Since Django uses URL rewriting it is looking for templates to fit these requests which raises a <code>TemplateDoesNotExist</code> exception and then a 500 message (Django does this not me). I have debug turned off so they only get the generic 500 message but it's filling up my logs very quickly.</p> <p>Is there a way to turn this behavior off? Or perhaps just block the IP's doing this?</p>,python|django|apache|spam-prevention
291270,Rails & Windows,<p>Is Rails development really this hard on Windows? I'm a PHP developer looking forwards to using Rails (mainly because every single PHP framework I've tried has some quirk that I just hate).</p> <p>I downloaded Aptana Studio (w/ RadRails) as it seemed to be a good solution (and because I love anything Eclipse-based). But that's where the problems begin - upon creating a project (called test  using sqlite3) the first problem I hit is some sqlite3 is missing error. So I Google around a bit and install sqlite3-ruby with gem. I still got some error - but somehow managed to fix it. So it seems to work but is this really it? Some environment that barely seems to work and has a lot of problems (<a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/164896/limitations-in-running-rubyrails-on-windows >see this</a>)?</p> <p>In some other question I saw the suggestion to run the project in a VM instead and edit it from Windows. Sounds like a good idea - but the two major Rails IDE's (RadRails NetBeans unless there's more) seem to want to run their own server in Windows. What would be the best setup for them/how would I set up a project in them if I'd run a Linux Rails stack in a VM instead?</p> <p>Note that I'd rather not work without an IDE - upon trying one for PHP I instantly became completely dependent (sigh) on them - and since I've never really used Ruby (or Rails) before having code completion would be a major help.</p> <p>So what are your suggestions? Run in Windows or Windows &amp; Linux stack in VM? Any other tips?</p> <p>Thanks!</p>,ruby-on-rails|ruby|netbeans|radrails

109970,How should I organize my ASP.Net themes and common CSS files,<p>I am currently working on a project where a programmer who fancied themselves a graphic designer attempted their hand at ASP.Net themes.

Imagine that there is a directory structure that looks something like this:</p> <ul> <li>Themes <ul> <li>Theme A <ul> <li>StyleA.css</li> <li><em>Common.css</em></li> </ul></li> <li>Theme B <ul> <li>StyleB.css</li> <li><em>Common.css</em></li> </ul></li> <li>Theme C <ul> <li>StyleC.css</li> <li><em>Common.css</em></li> </ul></li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>Each theme has a common stylesheet in it. Unfortunately the author of those style sheets managed to change only a few things here and there in each copy of <em>Common.css</em>. Eventually I will evaluate whether or not those changes are even necessary but some major cleanup needs to happen first. For now just assume that the changes ever so small are necessary for things to look right with each theme.</p> <p>I would like to know what the best practices are for using themes while also needing some common styles across your application.

Should this be called after every query (as a private function) or externally via the object... because I was thinking something like (code is an example only)</p> <pre><code>$students = $db-&gt;query('SELECT id FROM students'); $teachers = $db-&gt;query('SELECT id FROM teachers'); </code></pre> <p>Now if it was closing after every query would this slow it down a lot as opposed to me just adding this line to the end</p> <pre><code>$db-&gt;disconnectFromDB(); </code></pre> <p>Or should I just include that line above at the very end of the page?</p> <p>What advantages/disadvantages do either have?

92225,What are the best resources for design patterns and their uses?,<p>When it comes to the use of design patterns I am guessing there are three types of shops. Those who wouldn't know a pattern if it hit them in the face - these usually prefer the Ctrl-C / Ctrl-V approach to code-reuse. Those who spend hours a day searching their legacy code in hopes of implementing one more great pattern - these usually spend more time refactoring the code of simple programs than would ever be spent in a hundred years of maintenance. And finally those who walk the middle path using patterns when they make sense and coding whatever comes first for minimally exposed code.</p> <p>I'm wondering if anyone has locked down a good approach to a balanced incorporation of pattern use in the software development life cycle.

Why? Improve</li> <li>Whats the Best Software you have used? why Improve?</li> </ol> <p>Original Technical Question(As asked by the interviewer)</p> <p>Given a Range of numbers M.....M+N-1 I contruct an array of size N and replace one of the element in that array with a number. How will you find what element is replaced?</p> <p>I asked him to repeat the question once more as I thought the input was not sufficient to solve the problem. He repeated the statement ditto</p> <p>Q. Then I asked him Is the array you got from the range of number in sorted order?<br> Interviewer: Its not necessary</p> <p>Q Do we know the array before we replace an Element?<br> Interviewer: No</p> <p>Then i started Writing some pseudo code(while doing loud thinking). I immediately realized that It wont work if the original array had duplicates. So I was stuk for a while thinking how the hell am gonna solve this.Then finally I asked questions that mattered</p> <p>Q How do you choose the elements from the Range to form the array?<br> Interviewer: I have a range of number M M+1 M+2....M+N-1. A number is picked only once. And I form an array of size N.(Which essentially means no Duplicates and all elements in the range get picked)</p> <p>Q What about the number you replace it with? Does it lie in the same range?<br> Interviewer: Yes it does.</p> <p>Then everything became clear</p> <p><strong>This was what he meant:</strong><br> Q I have a range of numbers starting from M  like MM+1M+2M+3...M+N . I form an array of Size N such that each element gets picked only once and the original array does not have any duplicates. I replace one of the elements in the array with a number in the same range. Find out what I picked from the range to replace?</p> <p>This is equivalent to finding duplicates in array. Here after replacement there will be only one pair of duplicates We can easily find that out in O(N^2) time or O(nlogn) time. I gave him both the algorithms.</p> <p>In the end I couldnt resist asking him How did I perform in that question? He said Well you took a lot of time in answering.</p> <p><em>Clearly he was not satisfied with my approach to this question.<br> <strong>What do you think I should have done differently while answering this question?</em></strong></p>,algorithm

284889,What data access strategy for a large application,<p>I am about to embark on a rewrite of a VB6 application in .NET 3.5sp1. The VB6 app is pretty well written and the data layer is completely based on stored procedures. I'd like to go with something automated like Linq2SQL/Entity Framework/NHibernate/SubSonic. Admittedly I haven't used any of these tools in anything other than throwaway projects. </p> <p>The potential problem I fear I might have with all these choices is speed. For instance right now to retrieve a single row (or the entire list) I use the following sproc:</p> <pre><code>ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[lst_Customers] @intID INT = NULL @chvName VARCHAR(100) = NULL AS SELECT Customer_id Name FROM dbo.Customer WHERE (@intID IS NULL OR @intID = Customer_id) AND (@chvName IS NULL OR Name like ('%' + @chvName + '%')) ORDER BY name </code></pre> <p>To retrieve a single row in Linq2SQL/Entity Framework/NHibernate/SubSonic would these solutions have to bring the entire list down to the client and find the row that I need?</p> <p>So what's the consensus for the data access strategy for an application with a large data domain?</p>,.net|stored-procedures|vb6|legacy|data-access-layer
294468,Note onset detection,<p>I am developing a system as an aid to musicians performing transcription. The aim is to perform automatic music transcription (it does not have to be perfect as the user will correct glitches / mistakes later) on a single instrument monophonic recording. Does anyone here have experience in automatic music transcription? Or digital signal processing in general? Help from anyone is greatly appreciated no matter what your background.</p> <p>So far I have investigated the use of the Fast Fourier Transform for pitch detection and a number of tests in both MATLAB and my own Java test programs have shown it to be fast and accurate enough for my needs. Another element of the task that will need to be tackled is the display of the produced MIDI data in sheet music form but this is something I am not concerned with right now.</p> <p>In brief what I am looking for is a good method for note onset detection i.e. the position in the signal where a new note begins. As slow onsets can be quite difficult to detect properly I will initially be using the system with piano recordings. This is also partially due to the fact I play piano and should be in a better position to obtain suitable recordings for testing. As stated above early versions of this system will be used for simple monophonic recordings possibly progressing later to more complex input depending on progress made in the coming weeks.</p>,audio|signal-processing

So it's all pretty much working.</p> <p>But what would be really cool would be to <em>display the name of the function that failed</em>.</p> <p>Then I can decide whether to debug it without trying to guess what function it's in from the filename.</p> <p>e.g. if I have the following function:</p> <pre><code>int CMainFrame::OnCreate(LPCREATESTRUCT lpCreateStruct) { ASSERT(lpCreateStruct-&gt;cx &gt; 0); ... } </code></pre> <p>Then when the ASSERT fires the messagebox would show something like:</p> <pre><code>Function = CMainFrame::OnCreate </code></pre> <p><strong>So what's the simplest way of finding out the current function name at runtime?</strong></p> <p><em>It should not use MFC or the .NET framework even though I do use both of these.<br> It should be as portable as possible.</em></p>,c++|function|assert

813534,DRY vs. prefer containment over inheritance,<p>There is a general rule of OO design that you should model is-a relationships using inheritance and has-a relationships using containment/aggregation and forwarding/delegation. This is further narrowed by the admonishment from the GoF that you should generally favor containment over inheritance suggesting perhaps that if you could make a strong case for either one in a particular situation that containment should generally get the nod due to the maintenance problems inheritance can sometimes cause.</p> <p>I understand the reasoning behind this thinking and I don't necessarily disagree with it. However when I see a class with scores of methods each just forwarding to some instance variable I see a form of code duplication. Code duplication is in my opinion the ultimate code smell. Reimplementing an enormous protocol of methods just because the relationship between two classes isn't strictly is-a seems like overkill. It is additional unnecessary code added to the system code that now needs be tested and documented like any other part of the system--code that you likely wouldn't have had to write if you just inherited.</p> <p>Do the costs of adhering to this containment-over-inheritance principal ever outweigh its benefits?</p>,design-patterns|oop

633379,What .Net/WPF features do you miss when working in Silverlight?,<p>I recently started working with Silverlight and immediately noticed the difference between the Silverlight BCL and the full .Net and WPF. For some of them I've found great solutions posted online by other developers and others were more complicated. What features/classes were you surprised/disappointed to find absent from the Silverlight class libraries and what did you do to work around them?</p> <p>Some of mine were:</p> <ol> <li><strong>No event triggered animations</strong> - I created a helper class with static methods for attaching each type of animation I've used to storyboards in a shared library and at the application level I create classes with static methods to put them all together as I would have in XAML if working in WPF. So far this has been a good solution for keeping my animations organized and the logic out of my event handlers.</li> <li><strong>ScrollViewer doesn't support the mouse wheel</strong> - Adam Cooper created an excellent class library that adds this functionality that requires the bare minimum of code to implement in any Silverlight project. His site seems to be down at the moment so here's a link to Tim Heuer's blog that explains and links to it (so it'll be available when his site is back online). <a href= http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2008/09/23/mouse-wheel-support-for-scrollviewer.aspx >Add mouse wheel support to ScrollViewer in Silverlight</a></li> <li><strong><code>SortedDictionary&lt;T K&gt;</code> is missing.</strong> I found <a href= http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/tamir/archive/2007/10/15/sorted-dictionary-class-for-silverlight.aspx >this post</a> that contains an implementation but I didn't end up using it myself.</li> <li><strong>ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries is not available</strong> - Again...found someone who implemented this and posted the source code but it seemed to be a little complicated. I'll probably work through it a little bit but have yet to do so. <a href= http://www.codeproject.com/KB/silverlight/MergedDictionaries.aspx >MergedDictionaries in Silverlight</a></li> <li><strong>ZIndex attached property is only available on the Canvas object.</strong> I posted this as a question here on SO and someone made a great suggestion to wrap my containers in a collection if that's what it takes. It feels a little sloppy but you gotta do what you gotta do. My containers are nested three levels deep so I may need to warp them all in Canvas objects and set the Canvas.ZIndex three times for each event. Ugly as sin but if it's the only way then so be it.</li> </ol> <p>I'm interested to see what other common issues the more experienced Silverlight developers have come across and what you've done to fix them.</p>,.net|wpf|silverlight|xaml
619631,Know any C# syntax-highlighting tricks?,<p>I usually prefer to code with a black background and white/coloured text but I had never taken the time to change my syntax-highlighting in Visual Studio.</p> <p>Yesterday when I finally got around to it one of my changes was to change User Types and User Types (Value Types) to different colors. Without realizing it I had been using a struct type to pass and return data from methods more than I would have liked.</p> <p>This change in syntax-highlighting made it very apparent what was going on. So it made me wonder if there were other settings which could provide similar help.</p> <p>I also usually set my documentation and comment colours to something more washed out and passive so that actual code jumps more at you and makes quickly skimming through code faster.</p> <p>Do you have any other tips like this which can help spot issues or makes things more readable?</p> <p>Note: (I've seen <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/174121/syntax-highlighting-what-colors-do-you-like >this post</a> but I'm looking more for tips which are functional and provide help rather than purely cosmetic preferences.)</p>,c#|visual-studio|syntax-highlighting

597596,How do you overcome the html form nesting limitation?,<p>I know that xhtml doesn't support nested form tags and I have already read other answers<br /> here in stackoverflow regarding this subject but I still haven't figured out an elegant solution to the problem. </p> <p>Some say you don't need it and that they can't think of a scenario were this would be needed. Well personally I can't think of a scenario that I HAVEN'T needed it. </p> <p>Let's see a very simple example:</p> <p>You are making a blog app and you have a form with some fields for creating a new post and a toolbar with actions like Save  Delete  Cancel .</p> <pre><code>&lt;form action= /post/dispatch/too_bad_the_action_url_is_in_the_form_tag_even_though_conceptually_every_submit_button_inside_it_may_need_to_post_to_a_diffent_distinct_url method= post &gt; &lt;input type= text name= foo /&gt; &lt;!-- several of those here --&gt; &lt;div id= toolbar &gt; &lt;input type= submit name= save value= Save /&gt; &lt;input type= submit name= delete value= Delete /&gt; &lt;a href= /home/index &gt;Cancel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/form&gt; </code></pre> <p>Our objective is to write the form in a way that <em>doesn't require javascript</em> just plain old html form and submit buttons.</p> <p>Since the action url is defined in the Form tag and not in each individual submit button our only option is to post to a generic url and then start if...then...else to determine the name of the button that was submitted. Not very elegant but our only choice since we don't want to rely on javascript. </p> <p>The only problem is that pressing Delete  will submit ALL the form fields on the server even though the only thing needed for this action is a Hidden input with the post-id. Not very big deal in this small example but I have forms with hundreds (so to speak) of fields and tabs in my LOB applications that (because of requirements) have to submit everything in one-go and in any case this seems very inefficient and a waste. If form nesting was supported I would at least be able to wrap the Delete submit button inside it's own form with only the post-id field.</p> <p>You may say Just implement the Delete as a link instead of submit . This would be wrong in so many levels but most importantly because Side-effect actions like Delete here should never be a GET request.</p> <p>So my question (particularly to those that say they haven't needed form nesting) is What do YOU do? Is there any elegant solution that I'm missing or the bottom line is really Either require javascript or submit everything ?</p>,html|forms|nested

What I thought the program should then do is perform the check(string first_half string second_half) function after iterating this and decide that both of the strings match (which should according to various sources return 0) this should then initiate the if statement within check() and set the boolean achieved to true ending the program within the main statement and printing the result before exiting the program. It does not do this however and this is my problem. Thank you for any and all help.</p>,c++

483812,Vista live thumbnail issue with SetWindowRgn,<p>I know I am probably missing something but I can't seem to get windows to show the live thumbnail preview correctly when using a window that has a region. When hitting the minimize button the preview will clip to the minimized size (160x25) rather than showing the full preview (like it does with other windows). </p> <p>Few points to make:</p> <p>1) The preview works fine in Windows Live Messenger so Microsoft figured out a way to do it.</p> <p>2) If I call SetWindowRgn only before a window is visible it works fine (so its not a fault of the DWM not knowing how to deal with regioned windows.) I can call SetWindowRgn many times before the window is visible and it works great.</p> <p>3) I need to set the window region after I show the window in case of a resize. So a fix to just set it before will not work.</p> <p>4) Even when using the default window procedure the bug still happens. So it is not a fault of processing a message incorrectly (but could be a fault of 'not processing' one :) )</p> <p>5) When minimizing by clicking the taskbar button (instead of the minimize button in the window) the preview normally works fine (even after setting the region when visible). Again proving that it does not how to deal with the preview. </p> <p>The bug happens if I set a region after I have shown the window. Code to follow:</p> <pre><code>void create(HINSTANCE hInst) { char* className = default ; /* Register */ WNDCLASSEX wcex; memset(&amp;wcex0sizeof(wcex)); wcex.cbSize = sizeof(WNDCLASSEX); wcex.style = CS_HREDRAW | CS_VREDRAW; wcex.lpfnWndProc = DefWindowProc; wcex.hInstance = hInst; wcex.hCursor = LoadCursor(NULL IDC_ARROW); wcex.hbrBackground = (HBRUSH)(COLOR_WINDOW+1); wcex.lpszClassName = className; RegisterClassEx(&amp;wcex); /* Create */ HWND hwnd = CreateWindow(className className WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW CW_USEDEFAULT 0 CW_USEDEFAULT 0 NULL NULL hInst NULL); /* * Set the region * If set before the window is shown for the first time minimize preview on vista works */ RECT rect; GetWindowRect(hwnd&amp;rect); HRGN rgn = CreateRoundRectRgn(00rect.right-rect.leftrect.bottom-rect.top1515); SetWindowRgn(hwndrgnTRUE); /* Show the window */ ShowWindow(hwndSW_SHOW); /* * Set the region a second time. * Doing this will break minimize preview on vista */ rgn = CreateRoundRectRgn(00rect.right-rect.leftrect.bottom-rect.top3535); SetWindowRgn(hwndrgnTRUE); } int APIENTRY _tWinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance HINSTANCE hPrevInstance LPTSTR lpCmdLine int nCmdShow) { MSG msg; create(hInstance); while (GetMessage(&amp;msg NULL 0 0)) { TranslateMessage(&amp;msg); DispatchMessage(&amp;msg); } return (int) msg.wParam; } </code></pre>,winapi|windows-vista|thumbnails|minimize|dwmapi
9886996,Need suggestion on Cassandra Keyspaces sample,<p>I have been trying out Cassandra and need some help in understanding a few issues. I am new to cassandra and I am not sure of translating a MySQL DB to Cassandra would lead me to pitfalls which due to say inexperience or limited knowledge of cassandra. So I hope I can get the useful information from experienced cassandra users/developers.</p> <p>Below are sample keyspaces I have created. I would like to know any sort of drawback in the design if someone from their experience can point out.</p> <pre><code>create keyspace Students with placement_strategy = 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy' and strategy_options = {replication_factor:1}; use Students; create column family StudentID with column_type = 'Super' and comparator = 'UTF8Type' and subcomparator = 'UTF8Type' and default_validation_class = 'UTF8Type' and column_metadata = [{column_name : 'First Name' validation_class : UTF8Type} {column_name : 'Last Name' validation_class : UTF8Type} {column_name : 'Subjects' validation_class : UTF8Type} {column_name : 'Class' validation_class : UTF8Type}]; set StudentID[utf8('1968')]['00001']['First Name'] = 'Mark'; set StudentID[utf8('1968')]['00001']['Last Name'] = 'Myers'; set StudentID[utf8('1968')]['00001']['Subjects'] = 'Maths Chemistry'; set StudentID[utf8('1968')]['00001']['Class'] = '10th grade'; create keyspace Teachers with placement_strategy = 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy' and strategy_options = {replication_factor:1}; use Teachers; create column family TeacherID with column_type = 'Super' and comparator = 'UTF8Type' and subcomparator = 'UTF8Type' and default_validation_class = 'UTF8Type' and column_metadata = [{column_name : 'First Name' validation_class : UTF8Type} {column_name : 'Last Name' validation_class : UTF8Type} {column_name : 'Subjects' validation_class : UTF8Type} {column_name : 'Class' validation_class : UTF8Type}]; set TeacherID[utf8('777')]['234-333']['First Name'] = 'Mark'; set TeacherID[utf8('777')]['234-333']['Last Name'] = 'Myers'; set TeacherID[utf8('777')]['234-333']['Subjects'] = 'Maths Chemistryphysics'; set TeacherID[utf8('777')]['234-333']['Class'] = '10th grade 11th grade 9th grade'; create keyspace Subjects with placement_strategy = 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy' and strategy_options = {replication_factor:1}; use Subjects; create column family SubjectNames with default_validation_class = 'UTF8Type' and comparator = 'UTF8Type' and column_metadata = [{column_name : 'Names1' validation_class : UTF8Type}]; set SubjectNames[utf8('Current')]['Name1']= 'maths'; set SubjectNames[utf8('Current')]['Name2']= 'physics'; set SubjectNames[utf8('Current')]['Name3']= 'chemistry'; set SubjectNames[utf8('Current')]['Name4']= 'CS'; </code></pre> <p>Three keyspaces - Students Teachers and Subjects. I would definitely need some relationship amongst these keyspaces and would also require querying data. e.g.</p> <ul> <li>I would query for students with a certain subject and/or class</li> <li>A teacher with certain class</li> <li>List all subjects taken up by a certain student from a certain class.</li> </ul> <p>From what I know I would definitely need to create secondary indices to make the queries work. That is retrieving data on certain clauses. </p> <p>What I know if I am correct</p> <ul> <li>We donot have a 'like' clause in cassandra</li> <li>For each value for a column (the very last key-value pair) the value must be broken up. That is to individual words. Say I want to get a list of subjects so each subject must reside in a distinct column associated to it. I cannot query column values that are like subjectAsubjectB instead I would break it up to SubjectA and SubjectB and put them in different columns. </li> </ul> <p>Below are the keyspaces.</p> <p><img src= http://i.stack.imgur.com/re86f.png alt= students > <img src= http://i.stack.imgur.com/nCJeI.png alt= subject > <img src= http://i.stack.imgur.com/rDPjP.png alt= teachers ></p>,database|cassandra

15313348,Posting variable error,<p>At the moment I'm trying to add a new feature to my gallery. Basically in the galleries listings are cover photos and I'd like to allow myself to select a cover photo through the site without having to manually add the image address to my gallery table.</p> <p>At the moment I have this code below and I seem to be getting an error although I'm not too sure what's causing it whether it's the posting a variable - I'm not too sure :S.</p> <p>The code is supposed to use the url parameter to grab all necessary information from the gallery table and images table. I've also create the $imgurl variable which displays the image url to be inserted into the gallery table. The $galleryid variable is used to determine where the main column should be updated by adding the image url. It then connects and updates the gallery table by setting the 'main' column value to the image url already retrieved above where the gallery id equals the $galleryid variable also gained above.</p> <p>The error I'm receiving:</p> <p>Failed to run query: SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1064 You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '' at line 7</p> <pre><code>&lt;?php require ../../resources/includes/common.php ; include ../../resources/includes/image-retrieval.php ; $imgurl = htmlentities($row['url'] ENT_QUOTES 'UTF-8'); $galleryid = htmlentities($row['gallery'] ENT_QUOTES 'UTF-8'); $con = mysql_connect( localhost  user  password ); if (!$con) { die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error()); } $id = $_GET['id']; mysql_select_db( database  $con); $sql= UPDATE gallery SET main='$imgurl' WHERE id='$galleryid' ; if (!mysql_query($sql$con)) { die('Error: ' . mysql_error()); } header( Location: ../../image.php?id= . $id); die( Redirecting to: image.php ); mysql_close($con); ?&gt; </code></pre> <p>Any help would be much appreciated as I don't know where to go from here :S!</p>,php|mysql

621255,Force screen redraw after drawing to screen's DC C++,<p>I'm creating a Windows Mobile custom SIP and as the user presses or hovers over a button on the keyboard I draw it's corresponding selected image (iPhone-esque) to the screen's DC using ::GetDC(NULL).

I've tried everything I could think of to force it ::RedrawWindow() with all different combos of params using NULL or any of the Get..Window functions as the HWND and all combo of flags (INVALIDATE | UPDATENOW | ERASENOW | ALLCHILDREN etc). I've also tried invalidating the rect and forcing a repaint of the underlying app using ::GetActiveWindow and ::GetForegroundWindow variations using ::GetDesktopWindow etc. I've essentially run out of ideas and it's the last thing holding me up from using it on my Windows Mobile device. Does anyone have any ideas?

598331,passing arbitrary html to a popup window,<p>I am calling my makewindows function from a PHP file like so:</p> <pre><code>echo &lt;a href='#' onclick=\ makewindows( . $html . ); return false;\ &gt;Click for full description &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; ; </code></pre> <p>This generates correct html which results in a popupwindow containing the html from $html. For example(most of the html has been snipped):</p> <pre><code>&lt;a href= # onclick= makewindows(&amp;quot;&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;SPAN style=\&amp;quot;FONT-FAMILY: Arial\&amp;quot;&gt;&amp;quot;); return false; &gt;Click for more&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre> <p>Now I want to make an image above the link clickable to display an image instead of html using the same method.</p> <p>I made an $imagehtml variable in php like so:</p> <pre><code>$imagehtml = &lt;img src=' .$imageSrc. ' &gt; ; </code></pre> <p>$imageSrc is the result of another method but is always without fail a valid url for an image</p> <p>passing $imageHtml to makewindows should work(the fact that it is not standards complaint html is irelivant at least as to why what I am trying is failing. The same single line of html in a standalone html file displays in every browser fine.)</p> <p>this results in the following html:</p> <pre><code>&lt;a href= # onclick= makewindows(&lt;img src='removed.jpg' &gt;); return false; &gt; &lt;img src= removed.jpg width= 250 height= 250 &gt;&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre> <p>This completely fails. It has nothing to do with the image path as no window is created at all. All I am doing is changing the variable passed surely the window should still be created regardless of the contents of the html?</p> <p>this fails even if trying to pass about:blank for example defining imagehtml as follows:</p> <pre><code>$imagehtml = about:blank ; </code></pre> <p>results in:</p> <pre><code>&lt;a href= # onclick= makewindows(about:blank); return false; &gt;Click for full description &lt;/a&gt; </code></pre> <p>yet still no window.</p>,php|javascript

380415,Application to query a database and send results as file via HTTPS,<p>I've currently got a tool which allows me to configure a database connection (using JDBC) and specify a set of queries to run against the database. This is scheduled to run at a specific time of day (using cron or windows scheduler currently). The tool then exports the results to a file (xml) and sends this file to my server via HTTPS. This tool is installed on customers computers so that I can get some data feeds from them for later processing.</p> <p>I'd like to write a front-end to this that will make it easy for customers to set up the data extraction themselves. However I'm not really familiar with Rich Client front-end development (being a integration software developer) and was wondering whether there was an existing tool that would do all this or if it was worth learning a bit of Swing say so I could knock up a front-end. Do any of you know of a suitable tool?

7868776,Benefits of not passing entities to view,<p>I usually see people telling that you should not pass entities to your View. They say you should use a DTO/VO/ViewModel/AnyOtherThingYouWant instead as using an entity would increase the coupling. Ignoring the moments where I do need some extra logic (or I don't need all the properties) I fail to see any benefits in doing this. For example consider the following class:</p> <pre><code>public class Contact { public int Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } public string Email { get; set; } public string Phone { get; set; } } </code></pre> <p>I see lots of code that creates another class like this:</p> <pre><code>public class ContactDTO { public int Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } public string Email { get; set; } public string Phone { get; set; } } </code></pre> <p>use it in the View and then do this:</p> <pre><code>someMapper.Map(contactDto).To&lt;Contact&gt;(); </code></pre> <p>I can't see how better this is than simply using the Contact class as your View would be coupled to a class that is coupled to the entity's class. So every change in one should be replicated into the other. From my point of view the 'middle' object is there just to add complexity but not real value. I know that there's no 'one size fits all' solution (as sometimes using the middle object would make sense) but do we really need adding code like this?

The second structure is used by a DataGrid to produce a Master-Child relationship. We store SchoolClass and StudentInformation in classes as shown above. It would be good use of LINQ to be able to convert our initial List into a structure which can be used by the DataGrid.</p>,c#|linq

592260,Quick way to return a list of custom objects from a page method w/o a separate BLL,<p>I am using jQuery to retrieve a JSON object from a page method. I have a DAL which uses SubSonic and if I return objects created from SubSonic-generated classes I will clog up the pipes. :) You know all public properties get serialized. I don't want a separate business layer for this application because it's small and focused on read operations and yet another layer seems like an overkill. To avoid downloading some SubSonic bloated objects (possibly with sensitive information as well) and avoid building a separate layer I tried returning a list of objects like this:</p> <pre><code>[WebMethod] public static List&lt;object&gt; GetFiles() { FileCollection collection = DB .Select() .From(DataAccess.File.Schema) .ExecuteAsCollection&lt;FileCollection&gt;(); List&lt;object&gt; files = new List&lt;object&gt;(collection.Count); foreach (DataAccess.File file in collection) { files.Add(new { file.FileId file.ApplicantFirstName file.ApplicantLastName file.UploadDate } ); } return files; } </code></pre> <p>It works and I get a nice JSON object in return (disregard the DateTime value):</p> <pre><code>[{ FileId :1 ApplicantFirstName : Paweł  ApplicantLastName : Krakowiak  UploadDate : \/Date(1235656448387 )\/ }] </code></pre> <p>Is this a good approach? I am concerned about <code>List&lt;object&gt;</code> - is it worse than returning say a <code>List&lt;SomeDomainObject</code>>? Performance? Something else?</p> <p>This is .NET 2.0 I can't use 3.5 features. At least anonymous types work...</p>,c#|json|.net-2.0|subsonic

31412,Proprietary plug-ins for GPL programs: what about interpreted languages?,<p>I am developing a GPL-licensed application in Python and need to know if the GPL allows my program to use proprietary plug-ins. This is <a href= http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html >what the FSF has to say</a> on the issue:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>If a program released under the GPL uses plug-ins what are the requirements for the licenses of a plug-in?</strong></p> <p>It depends on how the program invokes its plug-ins. If the program uses fork and exec to invoke plug-ins then the plug-ins are separate programs so the license for the main program makes no requirements for them.</p> <p>If the program dynamically links plug-ins and they make function calls to each other and share data structures we believe they form a single program which must be treated as an extension of both the main program and the plug-ins. This means the plug-ins must be released under the GPL or a GPL-compatible free software license and that the terms of the GPL must be followed when those plug-ins are distributed.</p> <p>If the program dynamically links plug-ins but the communication between them is limited to invoking the ‘main’ function of the plug-in with some options and waiting for it to return that is a borderline case. </p> </blockquote> <p>The distinction between fork/exec and dynamic linking besides being kind of artificial doesn't carry over to interpreted languages: what about a Python/Perl/Ruby plugin which gets loaded via <code>import</code> or <code>execfile</code>?</p> <p>(edit: I understand why the distinction between fork/exec and dynamic linking but it seems like someone who wanted to comply with the GPL but go against the spirit --I don't-- could just use fork/exec and interprocess communication to do pretty much anything).</p> <p>The best solution would be to add an exception to my license to explicitly allow the use of proprietary plugins but I am unable to do so since I'm using <a href= http://trolltech.com/products/qt >Qt</a>/<a href= http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro >PyQt</a> which is GPL.</p>,python|open-source|plugins|licensing|interpreted

252972,Dynamic patching of databases,<p>Please forgive my long question. I have an idea for a design that I could use some comments on. Is it a good idea to do this? And what are the pit falls I should be aware of? Are there other similar implementations that are better?</p> <p><strong>My situation is as follows:</strong><br /> I am working on a rewrite of a windows forms application that connects to a SQL 2008 (earlier it was SQL 2005) server. The application is an expert-system for an engineering company where we store structured data about constructions. We have control of all installations of the client software we have no external customers or users they are all internal to the company and they are all be trusted not to do anything malicious to the software or database.</p> <p>The current design doesn't have too many tables (about 10 - 20) but some of them have millions of records that belong to several hundred constructions. The systems performance has been ok so far but it is starting to degrade as we are pushing the limits of the design. </p> <p>As part of the rewrite I am considering splitting the database into one master database and several child databases where each describes one construction. Each child database should be of identical design. This should eliminate the performance problems we are seeing today since the data stored in each database would be less than one percent of the total data amount. </p> <p>My concern is that instead of maintaining one database we will now get hundreds of databases that must be kept up to date. The system is constantly evolving as the companys requirements change (you know how it is) and while we try to look forward to reduce the number of changes the changes will come. So we will need a system where we keep track of all database changes done to the system so they can be applied to the child databases. Updating the client application won't be a problem we have good control of that aspect.</p> <p>I am thinking of a change tracing system where we store database scripts for all changes in a table in the master database. We can then give each change a version number and we can store a current version number in each child database. When the client program connects to a child database we can then check the version number of the database against the current version number of the master database and if there are patches with version numbers greater than the version number of the child database we run these and update the child database to the latest version. </p> <p>As I see it this should work well. Any changes to the system will first be tested and validated before committed as a new version of the database. The change will then be applied to the database the first time a user opens it. I suppose we would open the database in exclusive mode while applying the changes but as long as the changes aren't too frequent this should not be a problem.</p> <p>So what do you think? Will this work? Have any of you done something similar? Should we scrap the solution and go for the monolithic system instead?</p>,sql|sql-server|database|design
561212,Does Visual Studio Professional come with SQL Server Developer (not Express) edition?,<p>A co-worker and I are disagreeing on this. He thinks we have licenses for SQL Developer because we purchased VS 2005 Professional. It's been a while since I've installed it but I don't recall that being part of the installation whatsoever. It's always been a separate install and license. Been to the MS VS site and can't find anything about it coming with SQL Server anywhere. I think he is referring to the MS launch events where VS and SQL came in a pack together as part of the launch.</p> <p>Anyone know for sure? Thanks in advance.</p> <p>I should add that there is a difference between sql express and sql developer. I think express has been bundled with all kinds of things.

127794,Child Control Initialization in Custom Composite in ASP.NET,<p>Part of the series of controls I am working on obviously involves me lumping some of them together in to composites. I am rapidly starting to learn that this takes consideration (this is all new to me!) :)</p> <p>I basically have a <code>StyledWindow</code> control which is essentially a glorified <code>Panel</code> with ability to do other bits (like add borders etc).</p> <p>Here is the code that instantiates the child controls within it. Up till this point it seems to have been working correctly with mundane static controls:</p> <pre><code> protected override void CreateChildControls() { _panel = new Panel(); if (_editable != null) _editable.InstantiateIn(_panel); _regions = new List&lt;IAttributeAccessor&gt;(); _regions.Add(_panel); } </code></pre> <p>The problems came today when I tried nesting a more complex control within it. This control uses a reference to the page since it injects JavaScript in to make it a bit more snappy and responsive (the <code>RegisterClientScriptBlock</code> is the only reason I need the page ref).</p> <p>Now this was causing object null errors but I localized this down to the render method which was of course trying to call the method against the [null] <code>Page</code> object.</p> <p>What's confusing me is that the control works fine as a standalone but when placed in the <code>StyledWindow</code> it all goes horribly wrong!</p> <p><strong>So it looks like I am missing something in either my <code>StyledWindow</code> or <code>ChildControl</code>. Any ideas?</strong></p> <h2>Update</h2> <p>As <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/127794/child-control-initialization-in-custom-composite-in-aspnet#127824 >Brad Wilson</a> quite rightly pointed out you do not see the controls being added to the <code>Controls</code> collection. This is what the <code>_panel</code> is for this was there to handle that for me basically then override <code>Controls</code> (I got this from a guide somewhere):</p> <pre><code> Panel _panel; // Sub-Control to store the Content . public override ControlCollection Controls { get { EnsureChildControls(); return _panel.Controls; } } </code></pre> <p>I hope that helps clarify things. Apologies.</p> <h2>Update Following <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/127794/child-control-initialization-in-custom-composite-in-aspnet#128299 >Longhorn213's Answer</a></h2> <p>Right I have been doing some playing with the control placing one within the composite and one outside. I then got the status of Page at event major event in the control Lifecycle and rendered it to the page.</p> <p>The standalone is working fine and the page is inited as expected. However the one nested in the Composite is different. It's <code>OnLoad</code> event is not being fired at all! So I am guessing Brad is probably right in that I am not setting up the control hierarchy correctly can anyone offer some advice as to what I am missing? Is the Panel method not enough? (well it obviously isn't is it?!) :D</p> <p>Thanks for your help guys appreciated :)</p>,asp.net|controls|custom-server-controls

33852,Using Unsigned Primitive Types,<p>Most of time we represent concepts which can never be less than 0. For example to declare length we write:</p> <pre><code>int length; </code></pre> <p>The name expresses its purpose well but you can assign negative values to it. It seems that for some situations you can represent your intent more clearly by writing it this way instead:</p> <pre><code>uint length; </code></pre> <p>Some disadvantages that I can think of:</p> <ul> <li>unsigned types (uint ulong ushort) are not CLS compliant so you can't use it with other languages that don't support this</li> <li>.Net classes use signed types most of the time so you have to cast</li> </ul> <p>Thoughts?</p>,c#|primitive-types

Basically I need a matched list of Customers and Products they do NOT own.</p> <p>Another twist: I need to pair one customer per product. So If 5 customers do not have Product A only the first customer in the query should have Product A. So the results would look something like this:</p> <p>(Assume that all customers own product B And more than one customer owns products A C and D)</p> <ol> <li>Customer 1 Product A</li> <li>Customer 2 Product C</li> <li>Customer 3 Product D</li> </ol> <p>Final twist: I need to run this query as part of an UPDATE statement in SQL Sever. So I need to take the value from the first row:</p> <p>Customer 1 Product A</p> <p>and update the Customer record to something like</p> <pre><code>UPDATE Customers SET Customers.UnownedProduct = ProductA WHERE Customers.CustomerID = Customer1ID </code></pre> <p>But it would be nice if I could do this whole process in one SQL statement. So I run the query once and it updates 1 customer with a product they do not own. Hope that's not too confusing for you!

24160314,How to synchronize setTimeout and mobile.navigate using jQuery Mobile?,<p>I'm creating a small quiz mobile app using jQuery Mobile and I'm displaying a 3 second GIF at certain points. Though because it is shown many times I don't want to bother the user each time and if he/she clicks anywhere on the page it goes to the next page but I also have set up a setTimeout which waits for three seconds meaning of the GIF to display completely and then moves to the next page. As you can see this makes a problem. If I click the GIF it moves to the next page and then if I again move to the other page after three seconds are passed it sends me back to the previous page due to the setTimeout. I have the following code:</p> <p><strong>EDIT :</strong></p> <pre><code>$(document).on( pagechange  function(event ui) { var clicked = false; // Here comes some if-else statements checking which page is currently active else if ($.mobile.activePage[0].id == correctGIF ) { correct++; nextpage = hashtag.concat(page 'Correct'); $('#correctGIF').append('&lt;img src= images/Correct1.gif &gt;'); $('#correctGIF').click(function() { clicked = true; $.mobile.navigate(nextpage); alert( alert from click ); }); setTimeout(function() { if (!clicked) { $.mobile.navigate(nextpage); alert( alert from timeout ); } } 3000); } </code></pre> <p>So I need to somehow synchronize it. If there is a click it should ignore the setTimeout part and if there is no click it should wait for three seconds for the GIF to finish meaning should activate the setTimeout part. Also please note that this GIF is displayed many times during the quiz not just once. Any ideas about this?</p>,javascript|jquery|html|jquery-mobile|mobile

11192675,How can I iterate over two or more template indexes with Haystack Whoosh and Django,<p>I was reading the docs and some questions around here and couldn't understand how can I return a query that has fields indexed in two different classes. Let me put the code below:</p> <p>Here I have the classes:</p> <pre><code>class T031003Index(RealTimeSearchIndex): text = CharField(document=True use_template=True) C003INST = IntegerField(model_attr='C003INST') C003CHCD = CharField(model_attr='C003CHCD') C003MTR = CharField(model_attr='C003MTR') C003RZSC = CharField(model_attr='C003RZSC') def index_queryset(self): return T031003.objects.all() def prepare(self obj): self.prepared_data = super(T031003Index self).prepare(obj) self.prepared_data['text'] = obj.C003CHCD return self.prepared_data site.register(T031003 T031003Index) </code></pre> <p>And the second one:</p> <pre><code>class T031002Index(RealTimeSearchIndex): text = CharField(document=True use_template=True) C002USER = CharField(model_attr='C002USER') def index_queryset(self): return T031002.objects.all() def prepare(self obj): self.prepared_data = super(T031002Index self).prepare(obj) self.prepared_data['text'] = obj.C002USER return self.prepared_data site.register(T031002 T031002Index) </code></pre> <p>And I have two template indexes for each of them:</p> <p>T031003_text:</p> <pre><code>{{ object.C003INST }} {{ object.C003CHCD }} {{ object.C003MTR }} {{ object.C003RZSC }} </code></pre> <p>T031002_text:</p> <pre><code>{{ object.C002USER }} {{ object.C002INST }} </code></pre> <p>My template code:</p> <pre><code>{% if page.object_list %} {% for object in page.object_list %} &lt;br&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;font class= font &gt; {{ object.C003RZSC }} {{ object.C003INST }} {{ object.C003CHCD }} {{ object.C003MTR }} {{ object.C002USER }} &lt;/li&gt; {% endfor %} </code></pre> <p>My view:</p> <pre><code>def search(req): return SearchView(template='search.html')(req) </code></pre> <p>If I type in the search box a value from a field let's say that belongs to class T031002Index (like user = vane ) it gives me the result:</p> <p> None None None None vane </p> <p>And if I type a value from a field in class T031003Index it gives me the result:</p> <p> pencil 1 school material general None </p> <p>I have between these two classes in models.py a Foreign Key field which is C002INST.</p> <p>Could you guys give me an explanation?

1571389,Automapper - Nested entities,<p>I'm updating or creating an entity that has a child relationship say the aggregate root is Product (ProductId Title) which has zero or more ProductSuppliers (ProductSupplierId SuppliedAtPrice SupplierInfoId) and the DTO represents a similar structure (all the info). Simple enough.</p> <p>I've created a simple map for ProductDTO and ProductSupplierDTO and it works I guess as intended for new entities. </p> <p>However when processing the DTO I might be updating an existing entity so I do something like this:</p> <pre><code>Product product = productService.GetViaProductId(productDTO.ProductId) ?? new Product(); productDTOMapper.Map(productDTO product); productService.Update(product); </code></pre> <p>For primitive types existing on Product its fine as any ORM will recognize if the values are dirty or not. However I don't want Automapper to just replace Product.Suppliers with the new set I want to plug in some logic somewhere to iterate over product.Suppliers and check if an entity already exists and update that or create a new one ProductSupplier is not a value object it has an Id ProductSupplierId. </p> <p>I can't find where to plug this in within the mapping. </p> <p>Any suggestions? </p>,mapping|automapper

653586,VS2008 TFS: Is it possible to change the default Check-in Action for work items?,<p>When I check in code to our Team Foundation Server I some times (probably more often than I actually do...) should associate my check-in with a task or a bug I am working towards. When I mark a task or a check in it sets the Check-in Action to Resolve. But almost always I just want to have it as just Associate. The result is that I often end up marking a task as resolved by mistake. Is there a way to make Associate the default when I mark a task?</p> <p>Resolving a bug or a task should be something I actively select.

The program itself is running fine and starts up in seconds.

I have also uninstalled all extensions resharper etc. The only extensions remaining are VisualHg Ankh and Nuget.</p> <p>I have an i7 with 16 gigs of RAM so hardware is NOT the issue.</p> <p>Is there some sort of cache or files that VS could have locked onto?</p> <p>How can I figure out what is causing the issue?</p> <hr> <p>Well thanks to @jv42's suggestion I installed the perfwatson extension and that sorted out the issue.

But it seems that the elements from <code>new_end</code> to <code>V.end()</code> are <em>not</em> the even integers that we're deleting. For example if <code>v</code> starts out as <code>1 4 2 8 5 7</code> then I'm getting <code>8 5 7</code> for those elements (although after the <code>erase</code> call the vector indeed has <code>1 5 7</code> left).</p> <p>Apparently (according to <a href= http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/remove_if.html rel= nofollow >http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/remove_if.html</a>)</p> <pre><code>The iterators in the range [new_last last) are all still dereferenceable but the elements that they point to are unspecified. </code></pre> <p>First of all WTF?

This needs to be rendered at 100% height with the top row having a fixed size and the second row stretching to fit the rest of the available area.</p> <p>I have used the following code:</p> <pre><code>&lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;table style= border-collapse:collapse;height:100%;width:100%; &gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style= border:solid 1px black;height:100px &gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style= border:solid 1px black &gt;2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style= border:solid 1px black &gt;3&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style= border:solid 1px black &gt;4&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre> <p>This works as I require it to.</p> <p>The problem is when I put this in an ASP.NET page created in Visual Studio it adds a DOCTYPE element. After adding the DOCTYPE (and setting the CSS for the html and body tags to include height:100%) the top row of the table is much bigger than the bottom row and neither row is of a fixed height.</p> <p>I know I should use a DOCTYPE and not rely on quirks mode in Internet Explorer to ensure future compatibility. However I have tried all the DOCTYPEs I can find to try and change this behaviour to what I need but can't get it to work. It does work in Firefox but the job is for an Intranet where the users use IE7.</p> <p>If you want to see the problem try the following:</p> <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC -//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd &gt; &lt;html style= height:100% &gt; &lt;body style= height:100% &gt; &lt;table style= border-collapse:collapse;height:100%;width:100%; &gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style= border:solid 1px black;height:100px &gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style= border:solid 1px black &gt;2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style= border:solid 1px black &gt;3&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style= border:solid 1px black &gt;4&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre> <p>Does anyone know the answer?</p>,asp.net|html|css

750757,Data Transfer Objects and transactional service methods,<p>Is there any truly practical way to avoid using DTOs when passing data through Hibernate-backed transactional service methods? In other words are DTOs the only non-hacky solution to avoiding lazy initialization problems?</p> <p>I think the two popular alternatives to DTOs and the reasons I don't really like them are:</p> <ol> <li><p>Open Session in View pattern. This I don't like as I would like to keep the service methods truly transactional (i.e. the Hibernate session is committed and closed when the method exits). This is mainly because I would like to not have to worry about transactions if I for example need to publish the service as a web service later on.</p></li> <li><p>Passing domain/business objects through service methods instead of DTOs and eager fetching the needed attributes/properties. This is somewhat better. However in a non-trivial domain object hierarchy with complicated entity relations the eager fetching has to stop somewhere. And when it does I can't see how this wouldn't very quickly turn into a complete hackaton replacing entities with referencing ids all over the place.</p></li> </ol> <p>Am I missing something or are DTOs in fact the only solid approach from maintainability's point of view?</p>,hibernate|transactions|lazy-loading|dto|data-transfer-objects

Works great except that when I create a new document from code (so not load from file and modify) the result is all in one big line.

Replies usually say 'apply an XSL transformation' or 'add your own whitespace nodes'. Especially the last one makes me go %( so I'm hoping that in 2008 there's an easier way to pretty MSXML output.

2495988,How would you protect a database of links from being scraped?,<p>I have a large database of links which are all sorted in specific ways and are attached to other information which is valuable (to some people).</p> <p>Currently my setup (which seems to work) simply calls a php file like link.php?id=123 it logs the request with a timestamp into the DB. Before it spits out the link it checks how many requests were made from that IP in the last 5 minutes. If its greater than x it redirects you to a captcha page. </p> <p>That all works fine and dandy but the site has been getting really popular (as well as been getting DDOsed for about 6 weeks) so php has been getting floored so Im trying to minimize the times I have to hit up php to do something. I wanted to show links in plain text instead of thru link.php?id= and have an onclick function to simply add 1 to the view count. Im still hitting up php but at least if it lags it does so in the background and the user can see the link they requested right away. </p> <p>Problem is that makes the site REALLY scrapable. Is there anything I can do to prevent this but still not rely on php to do the check before spitting out the link? </p>,php|screen-scraping

173378,Has anyone built web-apps that can run totally off-line?,<p>I'm building an app that authors would (hopefully) use to help them uh.. <em>author</em> things.</p> <p>Think of it like a wiki but just for one person but cooler. I wish to make it as accessible as possible to my (potential) adoring masses and so I'm thinking about making it a web-app.</p> <p>It certainly doesn't have to be there is no integration with other sites no social features. It involve typing information into forms however so for rapid construction the web would probably be the best.</p> <p>However I don't really want to host it myself. I couldn't afford it for one but it's mostly that people who use this may not want their data stored elsewhere. This is private information about what they are writing and I wouldn't expect them to trust me with it and so I'm thinking about making it a thick-client app.</p> <p>And therein lies the problem how to make a application that focuses mainly on form data entry available easily to potential users (yay web apps) but also offline so they know they are in full control of their data (yay thick-client apps).</p> <p>I see the following solutions:</p> <ol> <li>Build it as a thick-client Java app and run a cutdown version on the net as an applet that people can play with before downloading the full thing.</li> <li>Build it as a Flex app for online and an Air app for offline (same source different build scripts basically).</li> <li>Build it as a standard web-app (HTML JS etc) but have a downloadable version that somehow runs the site <strong>totally</strong> on their computer. It wouldn't touch the net at all.</li> </ol> <p>Ignoring 1 and 2 (I'm looking into them separately) I think 3 would involve:</p> <ul> <li>Packaging up an install that contains a tiny webserver that has my code on it ready to run.</li> <li>Remapping the DB from something like mySQL to something like SQLite.</li> <li>Creating some kind of convience app that ran the server and opened your browser to the right location possibly using something like <a href= https://wiki.mozilla.org/Prism rel= nofollow >Prism</a> to hide the whole broswer thing.</li> </ul> <p>So <strong>have you ever done something like this before?</strong></p> <p>If so <strong>what problems did you encounter?</strong></p> <p>Finally <strong>is there another solution I haven't thought of?</strong>'</p> <p><em>(also <a href= http://joyent.com/developers/slingshot/ rel= nofollow >Joyent Slingshot</a> was a suggestion on another question but it's RoR (which I have no experience in) and I'm 99% sure it doesn't run under linux so It's not right for me.)</em></p>,design|offline

Instead of working on it in another folder somewhere and then copying it into the main project folder can I create a sub-folder which is dedicated to that dialog and then somehow incorporate it into the main project?</p>,qt

55862,How to implement password protection for individual files?,<p>I'm writing a little desktop app that should be able to encrypt a data file and protect it with a password (i.e. one must enter the correct password to decrypt). I want the encrypted data file to be self-contained and portable so the authentication has to be embedded in the file (or so I assume).</p> <p>I have a strategy that appears workable and seems logical based on what I know (which is probably just enough to be dangerous) but I have no idea if it's actually a good design or not. So tell me: is this crazy? Is there a better/best way to do it?</p> <ul> <li>Step 1: User enters plain-text password e.g. MyDifficultPassword </li> <li>Step 2: App hashes the user-password and uses that value as the symmetric key to encrypt/decrypt the data file. e.g. MyDifficultPassword --> HashedUserPwdAndKey . </li> <li>Step 3: App hashes the hashed value from step 2 and saves the new value in the data file header (i.e. the unencrypted part of the data file) and uses that value to validate the user's password. e.g. HashedUserPwdAndKey --> HashedValueForAuthentication </li> </ul> <p>Basically I'm extrapolating from the common way to implement web-site passwords (when you're not using OpenID that is) which is to store the (salted) hash of the user's password in your DB and never save the actual password. But since I use the hashed user password for the symmetric encryption key I can't use the same value for authentication. So I hash it again basically treating it just like another password and save the doubly-hashed value in the data file. That way I can take the file to another PC and decrypt it by simply entering my password.</p> <p>So is this design reasonably secure or hopelessly naive or somewhere in between? Thanks!</p> <p>EDIT: clarification and follow-up question re: Salt.<br /> I thought the salt had to be kept secret to be useful but your answers and links imply this is not the case. For example <a href= ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-5v2/pkcs5v2-0.pdf >this spec</a> linked by erickson (below) says: </p> <blockquote> <p>Thus password-based key derivation as defined here is a function of a password a salt and an iteration count where the latter two quantities need not be kept secret.</p> </blockquote> <p>Does this mean that I could store the salt value in the same place/file as the hashed key and still be more secure than if I used no salt at all when hashing? How does that work?</p> <p>A little more context: the encrypted file isn't meant to be shared with or decrypted by others it's really single-user data. But I'd like to deploy it in a shared environment on computers I don't fully control (e.g. at work) and be able to migrate/move the data by simply copying the file (so I can use it at home on different workstations etc.).</p>,encryption|cryptography|passwords

1286997,Entity Framework success stories?,<p>So like many developers before me I am at the crossroads of choosing an ORM to learn thoroughly and move forward with for future projects. I have been playing with Entity Framework and so far like what I see although I have only tried simple things CRUD with clearly defined table relationships with a 1-1 table-entity mapping. I did some googling on Entity Framework and found mostly negative feedback... what concerns me the most is the complexity of the mapping xml and generated object classes... As well as the fact that they are dependent on component classes of the EF and therefore need to be respected as such when it comes to object model design considerations. As of now I am leaning towards NHibernate... for the relative simplicity of the mapping files and the fact that it can work with POCO objects that I craft to meet my object model design needs. There is even a LINQ provider for it as well as third party code generation tools. However... I don't wish to throw EF out the window just yet. Does anyone know of a successful production app written with EF? Or on the technical side any reasons I would want to lean towards EF now e.g. has corporate backing is new and therefore more likely to grow in feature set over time while NH has reached the equilibrium of maturity? I don't mean to start a color war here I'm just looking for positive things people may have to add about the EF before I make my decision.</p> <p>Thanks!</p>,nhibernate|entity-framework|orm

Otherwise you have to maintain the contract in two places (the test and the contract itself) or am I missing something?</li> <li>To what extent does TDD make DbC redundant? If I write tests well enough aren't they equivalent to writing a contract? Do I only get added benefit if I enforce the contract at run time as well as through the tests?</li> <li>Is it significantly easier/more flexible to only use TDD rather than TDD with DbC? </li> </ul> <p>The main point of these questions is this more general question: <strong>If we're already doing TDD properly will we get a significant benefit for the overhead if we also use DbC?</strong></p> <p>A couple of details though I think the question is largely language-agnostic:</p> <ul> <li>Our team is very small &lt;10 programmers.</li> <li>We mostly use Perl.</li> </ul>,language-agnostic|project-management|tdd|design-by-contract

197839,Is there any way to determine the size of a C++ array programmatically? And if not why?,<p>This question was inspired by a similar question: <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/197675/how-does-delete-know-the-size-of-the-operand-array >How does delete[] “know” the size of the operand array?</a></p> <p>My question is a little different: <strong>Is there any way to determine the size of a C++ array programmatically? And if not why?</strong> Every function I've seen that takes an array also requires an integer parameter to give it the size. But as the linked question pointed out <code>delete[]</code> must know the size of the memory to be deallocated.</p> <p>Consider this C++ code:</p> <pre><code>int* arr = new int[256]; printf( Size of arr: %d\n  sizeof(arr)); </code></pre> <p>This prints <code>Size of arr: 4</code>  which is just the size of the pointer. It would be nice to have some function which prints 256 but I don't think one exists in C++. (Again part of the question is why it doesn't exist.)</p> <p><strong>Clarification</strong>: I know that if I declared the array on the stack instead of the heap (i.e. <code>int arr[256];</code> ) that the <code>sizeof</code> operator would return 1024 (array length * sizeof(int)).</p>,c++|arrays|pointers|memory-management

It has only one end user (me) and all data is stored in my local machine (SQL Server / MySQL). I'm going to use Visual Studio Autofac NHibernate and try to implement MVVM DI DDD patterns.</p> <p>The same person could simultaneously displayed anywhere in the UI: in multiple windows tabs lists comboboxes textblocks... Each list could contain a few thousands persons and the whole application could have 10~100 lists. And the contents (persons) of the lists get updated frequently: <strong>Each time I change the settings of a list the list gets emptied then filled with another several thousands of new persons</strong>.</p> <p><strong>The problem is: If I modify a person (eg. change name) in one list how to apply the changes to all other lists?</strong></p> <p>I think there are 2 ways to solve this problem:</p> <ol> <li><p>For each person use a single instance through the entire application. To implement this I can use a single UnitOfWork through the application but it seems this approach would cause memory leak.</p></li> <li><p>Use multiple instances for each person (one instance per list). To implement this I think I should use one UnitOfWork for each list and I must find a way to synchronize all instances of a person. <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4963267/multiple-viewmodels-request-same-domain-object-should-i-give-them-the-same-diffe/4973732#4973732 >Berryl</a> mentioned event aggregator.

254090,Best approach for maintaining a quality assurance server for several mid tier clients,<p>We are getting to the point where we have several mid tier clients that could benefit from a QA server but none can afford to pay for a dedicated QA box as well as a dedicated production box. I've been toying with the idea of a virtual environment either hosted in our office or with a third-party that several clients could hit to view work in progress that would offset the total cost. Most of these sites will be a LAMP stack but there is the potential every long once in a great while that a .NET or Java site would be thrown into the mix. I'm looking for a solid approach but obviously not full implementation details.</p>,qa

670300,Crash when calling stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString on UIWebView from button,<p>I can't find any documentation to confirm this but it appears that you can only call the method <strong>stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString</strong> in overridden methods from a UIWebView delegate. Can anyone confirm this?</p> <p>Here's what I've tried. I setup a button on a view link it to a method on my viewcontroller and make sure it works fine. My view has a UIWebView control on it as well. If I run the project on the simulator or on the iPhone there are no issues. Then I add this code to the button's method.</p> <pre><code>[theWebView stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:@ alert('Hi there!'); ]; </code></pre> <p>When I run the project I can click the button and see the 'Hi there' prompt and I can click OK to dismiss it. Usually 4-5 seconds later the simulator crashes. I occasionally see the <code> __TERMINATING_DUE_TO_UNCAUGHT_EXCEPTION__ </code> error but not consistently; sometimes there's no error. It also doesn't always crash the first time. Sometimes I go to another page and then try it again and it crashes.</p> <p>If I put the same code in the webPageDidFinishLoad event it works fine. But I'd like the code to be called when the user demands it so that event doesn't suit my needs.</p> <p>I'm open to a workaround if you have any ideas? Thanks in advance!</p>,iphone

If so how can I do this? </p> <p>My syntax for this problem : </p> <p>In the cakephp framework i am building tests for a behavior that is configured by adding fields to the table. This is intended to work in the same way that adding the created and modified fields will auto-populate these fields on save.</p> <p>To test this I <em>could</em> create dozens of fixtures/model combos to test the different setups but it would be a hundred times better faster and easier to just have the fixture change shape between test methods. </p> <blockquote> <p>If you are not familiar with the <a href= http://cakephp.org rel= nofollow >CakePHP framework</a> you can maybe still help me as it uses <a href= http://simletest.org rel= nofollow >SimpleTest</a></p> </blockquote> <p><em>Edit: rephrased question to be more general</em></p>,unit-testing|cakephp|fixture

443294,Restoring Team Foundation Server,<p>We are thinking of moving from Subversion to Team Foundation Server for our source control requirements. The reasoning behind this being that our project teams are getting bigger and management feel more comfortable using a M'soft product rather than an open sourced solution (I know - I've tried to argue the foolishness of this statement but am not getting anywhere).</p> <p>So far we've had no issues except for in the case of replicating what would happen if the foundation server box completely died and we where left with just backups. We've tried following the plan at the following link - <a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms404869.aspx rel= nofollow >http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms404869.aspx</a> - but its proving hellish difficult! </p> <p>We're just wondering whether this is supposed to be such a pain or whether we're just really dim or something. I know with a combination of Subversion and Tortoise I could get the whole thing back up and running within a couple of hours but this is currently taking days. </p>,version-control|tfs|backup

363118,Disconnected Recordset,<p>Someone I know wants to use <a href= http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/webtech/080101-1.shtml rel= nofollow >diconnected recordsets</a> in an application. To me it sounds like if I have a ORM tool there would really be no need to even touch disconnected recordsets. The way I understand it with ORM the ORM takes care of not hugging connections for unnecessarily long amounts of time solving the need for a disconnected recordset. Is there an instance in which you would still want to use a disconnected recordset?</p>,orm|ado|recordset|disconnected-session
23316473,Null Pointer Exception when accessing a method of a class extends view from inside a sensor listener,<p>I want to pass the readings of a sensor to the class <code>MyCompassView</code> that extends a view and based on the readings from the sensor to be passed a pointer is changing its orientation. Actually all this works fine i tested it. But the same concept when I tried to implement it on a surface view that opens the camera preview on the surface it does not work and crashes the app. Simply I have <code>SurfaceViewHolder</code> class the holds the camera preview the <code>MyCompassView</code> class as described above and the <code>MainActivity</code> that should has both views of <code>MyCompassView</code> and <code>SurfaceHolder</code> on its surface. The way I used to overlay the <code>MainActivity</code> with these views is as posted below: please help me to find why the method <code>myCompassView.update(azimuth);</code>that is located inside the <code>onSensorChanged</code> cause the logcate to say Null Pointer Exception </p> <p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong>:</p> <p>When I omit <code>myCompassView.update(azimuth);</code> the app works but with drawings in the <code>MyCompassView</code> class is static not indicting orientation ofcourse because of the <code>myCompassView.update(azimuth);</code> is not activated.However when i activate that method<br> the app crashs and the logcat generates the posted output.

11820683,Permutation with repetition in Java (Strings are of the form: 00001112222),<p>I have strings of the form <code>000011122222</code>. That is consecutive digits repeated random no. of times. Some other examples could be:</p> <pre><code>0011122223333 01222 00011234444 001122222 </code></pre> <p>and so on. I know say for a string <code>01222</code> that a total of <code>5!/3!</code> permutations are possible. I need to generate all these permutations for each such string. </p> <p>I have tried generating permutations by various methods. One is by generating all the possible permutations (just as for strings without repetition) but since the strings that I would be using can be very large this can waste time generating too many redundant permutations.</p> <p>Secondly I have tried placing the digits at random indices of a character array equal to the size of the string and terminating the loop when the count of digits is same as in the input string. However this way I am wasting a lot of memory and also taking up a lot of time.</p> <p>I need an efficient way to generate permutations for such strings. Just an algorithm or code either is welcome.

279066,Looking for a hack to prevent rewriting an app without using session variables,<p>Our company uses an app that was originally ColdFusion + Access later converted to classic ASP + MS Sql for task/time tracking called the request system. It's broken down by department so there's one for MIS marketing logistics etc. The problem comes in when (mainly managers) are using more than one at a time with 2 browser windows open. The request system uses session variables a lot of session variables session is referenced 2300 times in the application. When 2 are open at once as you can imagine this causes all sorts of anomalies from the variables getting mixed up.</p> <p>There's a 3 year old MIS request in the system to fix this and it's been worked on by 3 developers and now it's my turn to take a shot at it. I was wondering if anyone else has had to work on a project like this and if there was some sort of hack to try and mitigate some of the problems. I was thinking of maybe calling something in global.asa to load misc. session variables from the querystring. The problem is there's all sorts of this going on:</p> <pre><code>If (Session( Application ) &lt;&gt; Request( App )) and Request( App ) &lt;&gt; THEN Session( Application ) = Request( App ) End If </code></pre> <p>Looking at the functions in include files you'll have a function with 4 parameters that makes references to 6 different session variables. So you get the idea this is going to be painful.</p> <p>Has anyone had to do anything like this in the past? Any hacks you found useful?</p>,asp-classic|session-variables

10655962,.net localization for non-strings,<p>I am localizing a WPF application using .resx files. I created copies of main Resources files like Resources.en-US.resx or Resources.cs-CZ.resx. Works well for strings. However I can't figure out how to localize other files like images or documents in resource files. </p> <p>When I add a new image to Resources file (either Resources.en-US.resx or Resources.cs-CZ.resx) a copy of the file is always copied to /Resources directory. So there cannot be multiple versions of one file for multiple languages because in one directory there can be only one file with same name. </p> <p>Ideal solution would be if images from localized resources would be copied in subdirectories like /Resources/en-Us. In current conditions I am unable to localize images and documents using .resx files. Any ideas how I can achieve this? Thank you.</p>,c#|.net|wpf|localization

Iso.available_filters.each do |filter| # We should have our array with our filter listing. # Check the purchase order model for a description filter_name = filter[0][:filter_name] # Filters are stored in a session variable this way filters survive # page reloads etc. First thing we do is set the session if new filters # have been set for the filter. session_name = session_filter_name( filter_name ) if params[session_name] if params[session_name] == 'All' session[session_name] = nil else session[session_name] = params[session_name] filter_to_use[filter_name] = params[session_name] end elsif session[session_name] # If params aren't read we still need to filter based off the users # session filter_to_use[filter_name] = session[session_name] end end # Just using this variable for now until I can refactor the helper code # so that this is passed in. @current_filter_values = filter_to_use filter_to_use[:page] = @current_page @isos = Iso.find_filtered( filter_to_use ) if @isos.out_of_bounds? filter_to_use[:page] = session[:previous_page] = @current_page = 1 @isos = Iso.find_filtered( filter_to_use ) end end </code></pre> <p>Now this code is exactly the same as code in another controller except for the model reference (in this case Iso).

However it doesn't let you know that the thing it's pointing to is also a symlink</p> <pre><code>ls -l /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home lrwxr-xr-x 1 root wheel 24 Feb 24 12:58 /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home -&gt; Versions/CurrentJDK/Home </code></pre> <p>This in turn doesn't let you know that <em>part of the path</em> of the pointed to file is a symlink.</p> <pre><code>ls -l /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK lrwxr-xr-x 1 root wheel 3 Feb 24 12:58 /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK -&gt; 1.5 </code></pre> <p>Which just to complete this tale is another symlink </p> <pre><code>ls -l /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.5 lrwxr-xr-x 1 root wheel 5 Feb 24 12:58 /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.5 -&gt; 1.5.0 </code></pre> <p>Finally pointing at a real folder.</p> <p>Are there any tools that can visualize the full chain of links for you in some way (either graphically or plain old text)?

282509,How do you communicate between eclipse declarative services and Views (ContentProviders),<p>Say you have an eclipse plugin with various views these views should display data from some OSGi bundle that pushes data to the Views. Rather than have every view communicate with the OSGi bundle I have an intermediate Facade class that acts as a blackboard for the views and manages communications between the views and the other OSGi bundle--well that's the theory.</p> <p>The problem comes about because the ui bundle (with the Views and the Facade) communicate with the other bundle (call it the DataStore) using Declarative Services. Since the Data Store receives asynchronous data updates from yet another source it needs to push content to the Facade (and to other bundles if they are available). OSGi instantiates the Facade to satisfy the requirements of the cardinality on the DataStore's DS configuration but the views are instantiated by the Plugin's IApplication implementation. Even if the IApplication and the Facade are the same class I get two separate instances that do not know of eachother. </p> <p>How do I enable communication between these components (the plugin Application Views etc. and the OSGi instantiated Facade)?</p>,communication|osgi|eclipse-pde|declarative-services

1164479,Using the distinct function in SQL,<p>I have a SQL query I am running.

628610,,<p>Actually it’s hard to beat a hierarchy for organizing large numbers of items. I wouldn’t favor a classical pulldown menu for vast numbers of windows because it would be even harder to keep track of where you are than in a tree (e.g. a tree lets you look in multiple branches at once). But here’s a few alternatives:</p> <p>I’m not clear how you ended up with so many windows but maybe it comes from combinations of classes views content and detail or maybe it comes from using a task-centered UI structure for something far too complex (I’ve more on that at <a href= http://www.zuschlogin.com/?p=3 rel= nofollow >http://www.zuschlogin.com/?p=3</a>). For complex apps you want a different primary window for each significant class of data object (e.g. invoices employees). These are listed on one menu and typically there’s few enough (15 or less) that it can be single non-cascading pulldown menu. The content of each window is set by a separate menu perhaps by a menu item that opens a dialog that may include a list box (like an Open dialog) or other controls for querying/searching. The “view” of each window (how the data objects are shown e.g. table versus form) is set by menu items in the View menu. Details for any given object in a window can be shown in a separate pane within the window in a master-detail relation essentially turning you data objects into a menu for details. A single window can have multiple detail panes for the user to open and close to select the specific detail to show. Tabs may also be used within a single pane to fit subdivisions of content.</p> <p>You say it’s not important to show all window options at once but often showing all options at once makes it easiest for users to find what they need. Maybe you need a “home” window that lists all the other windows in organized labeled and separated categories. This is will be easier to use than the tree if your users select a window then stick with it for most of the session. Your tree is better if there's frequently selection of windows throughout the session owing to the overhead of getting to the home window. If all windows/options don’t fit on a single home window then show only selected common windows for each category on the home window and provide a button or link to show an exhaustive list.</p> <p>If you’re talking 100’s of windows maybe you should have Search perhaps in addition to a menu-based browse approach to getting to a window.</p> <p>In any case providing easy access to the few most commonly used windows is a good idea. Such windows can be explicitly selected by the designer based on user research or selected by the the user (favorites) but it also typically works well to make it automatic with an algorithm that uses some combination of frequency and recency of use.</p>,

31394611,,<p>For beginning to learn category theory I recommend David Spivak's <em>Category Theory for the Sciences</em> (AKA <em>Category Theory for Scientists</em>) because its relatively comprehensible due to many examples that enable understanding by analogy and which quickly builds a foundation for understanding more abstract concepts.</p> <p>It requires the ability to reason logically and an intuitive notion of what is a set. It proceeds from sets and functions through basic category theory to adjoint functors categories of functors sheaves monads and an introduction to operads. Two main threads throughout are modeling databases in terms of categories and describing categories with annotated diagrams called <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olog rel= nofollow >ologs</a>. The bibliography provides references to more advanced and specialized topics including recent papers by Dr. Spivak. </p> <p>An expected outcome from reading this book is the capability of understanding category theory texts and papers written for mathematicians such as Mac Lane's <em>Category Theory for the Working Mathematician</em>.</p> <p>In PDF format it is available from <a href= http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/teaching/sp13/ rel= nofollow >http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/teaching/sp13/</a> (the dynamic version is recommended since its the most recent).

335949,,<p>If your users are using Task Manager to check your app's memory usage the odds are that they're looking at the <strong>Memory Usage</strong> column. As Stephen Martin says this is misleading as that column actually shows the app's full working set. This is made up of:</p> <ul> <li>The <strong>private</strong> working set - resident pages which are private only to your process.</li> <li>The <strong>shareable</strong> working set - resident pages which may be shared with other processes.</li> <li>The <strong>shared</strong> working set - resident pages which are currently being shared with other processes. This is a subset of the shareable working set.</li> </ul> <p>If this is the case you can play a little trick by manually reducing your app's full working set to its private/shared working set. This is done by using the Win32 API call <strong>SetProcessWorkingSetSize(GetCurrentProcess() -1 -1)</strong>. This is what Windows will do anyway when the system runs low on memory but controlling when this happens lets you strip your .NET app's full working set to its private/shared working set. This number is usually much smaller.</p> <p>How much smaller? Minimising your app to the taskbar does the same thing so you can check without changing any code.</p>,

670304,,<p>I'm not totally clear on what you're asking but this is what it sounds like:</p> <p>You know how to use POST and GET aka HTML forms to pass data between pages. You're using Javascript buttons. </p> <p>There are a couple of interpretations of Javascript buttons :</p> <p>Are you doing something like </p> <pre><code>(1) &lt;input type= submit onclick= doSomething(); value= Save my data /&gt; (2) &lt;input type= button onclick= doSomething(); value= Save my data /&gt; (3) &lt;button onclick= doSomething(); &gt;Save my data&lt;/button&gt; </code></pre> <p>Or something like</p> <pre><code>(4) &lt;input type= submit value= Save my data /&gt; </code></pre> <p>1 2 and 3 are examples of using javascript to make the buttons do stuff. ( Javascript buttons ). 4 is a standard HTML FORM button -- Javascript is NOT being used; the standard HTML form behaviors will cause the button to submit the data to whatever page is specified in the FORM tag (something like <code>&lt;form method= get action= datacollection.php &gt;</code> ).</p> <p>Now the thing to understand is that POST/GET are ways to send data around between webpages -- between the browser and the server. The process of sending the data around can be triggered by HTML (an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> link) Javascript (a function that calls a URL or triggers that a FORM get submitted) or FORM elements like <code>&lt;input type= submit /&gt;</code>.</p> <p>I'm not intending any offense but the way you asked your question makes me think that you're not trying to figure out different formats to transfer the data to the receiving page (as other posters discuss) and figuring out how to parse cookie values or iterate through your form fields to create a query string would be really challenging.</p> <p>So here are some options:</p> <ol> <li><p>If your form was already using Javascript to submit the form (cases 1 2 or 3 above) you just add the same onclick part to an HTML link:</p> Save my data </li> </ol> <p>The function submitMyForm might look something like this:</p> <pre><code>function submitMyForm() { // Get the form object -- you can also do this with the document.form array var myForm = document.getElementById( 'userdata' ); // use the submit method of the form object myForm.submit(); } </code></pre> <p>So in summary you'll add a javascript behavior ( event handler ) to a normal HTML anchor link. One note -- in general users expect the rule links go places buttons do things . It's not a hard and fast rule but people generally are happier when a button is used for things like submitting form data. </p>,

553719,,<p><strong>RE: Config data</strong> It might be a good idea to keep config data in the database to make it easier to edit it and keep track of the changes but then wright it out to a config file for the actual program to read. </p> <ul> <li><p>Why should apache have to know anything about your database information to be able to get to its configuration?</p></li> <li><p>Why should your FTP server stop working when the database is down?</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>RE: Application logs</strong></p> <p>As stated earlier a database can make log analyzing a lot easier but I urge you to consider the log-to-file-and-batch-import-later pattern.</p> <p><strong><em>Performance issues</em></strong></p> <p>Databases are great for getting random bits of data out and putting random bits of data in. Log data mostly is not written randomly but in a continues stream of data that is perfect for putting in a file one line after an other. You can't beat the performance of a flat file when it comes to writing the data. There's not a lot of things that can break with a flat file either. This also lets the database concentrate on doing the actual business work.</p> <p>Then later on you can collect all the logged data from the file parse it do any required post processing (like looking up host names from IP addresses) and put it into a database table. You do this as often as you find necessary. For my website I really don't need to be able to view the visitor stats change from one minute to the other so I run the log batch at night. If you need up to date info you can just as well run the batch import every 60 seconds but this will still be better than doing one extra INSERT statement for every actual business transaction (depending on how much you log of course).</p> <p><strong><em>Security</em></strong></p> <ul> <li><p>How do you log a failed database connection if the database is your log engine?</p></li> <li><p>How do you investigate why a system crashed if the database went down early during the events involved in the crash?</p></li> </ul> <p>So I think you should consider when you need the log data in the database and why you need it in there.</p>,

93067,,<p>As everyone here has already pointed out the issue is most likely caused by the C# application sending ints in little-endian order whereas the Java app expects them in network order (big-endian). However instead of explicitly rearranging bytes in the C# app the correct way is to rely on built-in functions for converting from host to network order (htons and the likes) -- this way your code will continue working just fine even when run on a big-endian machine.</p> <p>In general when troubleshooting such issues I find it useful to record the correct traffic (e.g. Java to Java in your case) using tools like netcat or wireshark and then compare it to the incorrect traffic to see where it's going wrong. As an added benefit you can also use netcat to inject the captured/prerecorded requests into the server or inject captured/prerecorded responses into the client. Not to mention that you can also modify the requests/responses in a file and test the results before commencing with fixing the code.</p>,

I'm pretty sure this is what solved this for me (it's a while ago..)</p> <p>Here is a copy of it:</p> <hr> <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br> The purpose of this note is to show how you create an ADF BC Application Module and how you deploy it on a JBoss Application Server. It will also show you what configurations you need to perform on the JBoss side in order for the Application Module to work correctly.</p> <p><strong>Scope &amp; Application</strong><br> This note is intended for anyone who is about to deploy an ADF BC Module to a JBoss Application Server.</p> <p><strong>How To Deploy an ADF BC Module to a JBoss Application Server</strong><br> The steps necessary for deploying an ADF BC Module to a JBoss Application Server are the following:</p> <ol> <li>Setup the ADF Runtime Libraries on the JBoss Server</li> <li>Setup data source(s) on the JBoss Server</li> <li>Configure the ADF BC Module</li> <li>Deploy the ADF BC Module</li> </ol> <p>I will go through each of these steps more detailed. There is also a complete example attached for download here. Setup the ADF Runtime Libraries on the JBoss Server</p> <ol> <li>Shutdown the Application Server.</li> <li>Invoke the ADF Runtime Installer wizard. Choose Tools | ADF Runtime Installer and choose a server type from the submenu.</li> <li>Proceed through the pages of the wizard. For detailed instructions for any page of the wizard click Help.</li> <li>On the Location page select the home (or root) directory of the server on which the libraries are to be installed.</li> <li>On the Installation Options page you may choose the operation that you wish to perform. * Install the ADF runtime libraries from your JDeveloper installation. * Uninstall previously installed ADF runtime libraries. * Restore an archived version of the ADF runtime libraries as the active version.</li> <li>On the Summary page click Migrate if you wish to prepare any existing UIX JSP projects for deployment.</li> <li>On the Summary page confirm the details of the installation and click Finish.</li> <li>Restart the application server.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Setup data source(s) on the JBoss Server</strong><br> To create an Oracle data source in the JBoss server you need to take the following steps:</p> <ol> <li><p>Create a file called oracle-ds.xml. This file will contain your data source configuration. Below is an example on how such a file can look like.</p> <pre><code>&lt;?xml version= 1.0 encoding= UTF-8 ?&gt; &lt;datasources&gt; &lt;local-tx-datasource&gt; &lt;jndi-name&gt;OracleDS&lt;/jndi-name&gt; &lt;use-java-context&gt;false&lt;/use-java-context&gt; &lt;connection-url&gt;jdbc:oracle:thin:@mydbhost.com:1521:mysid&lt;/connection-url&gt; &lt;driver-class&gt;oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver&lt;/driver-class&gt; &lt;user-name&gt;hr&lt;/user-name&gt; &lt;password&gt;******&lt;/password&gt; &lt;exception-sorter-class-name&gt;org.jboss.resource.adapter.jdbc.vendor.OracleExceptionSorter&lt;/exception-sorter-class-name&gt; &lt;/local-tx-datasource&gt; &lt;/datasources&gt; </code></pre></li> <li><p>Copy the file to the /deploy. This will install it on the JBoss server.</p></li> </ol> <p><strong>Configure the ADF BC Module</strong><br> There are a few steps that need to be taken upon the ADF BC Module in order for it to run on the JBoss server.</p> <p>When creating an ADF BC Module that will be used on a JBoss application server one needs to set the SQL Flavor to SQL92 and the Type Map to Java. This change is required when using JBoss as the Application Server.</p> <p>****Package the ADF Business Components project as an EJB session bean.****</p> <ol> <li>Right Click on the Application Module select Business Components Deployment.</li> <li>In the profiles Dialog select EJB Session Beans.</li> <li>In the EJB Session Beans dialog select Deploy To: Other EJB Container</li> <li>In the AppModules dialog configure the Application Module as seen in the figure 1 below.</li> </ol> <p>Figure 1. Configuration of the Application Module<br> <img src= http://i.stack.imgur.com/qhmuk.jpg alt= alt text ></p> <p>Once done your Project will look similar to the one shown in the figure 2 below.</p> <p>Figure 2. The JDeveloper Project<br> <img src= http://i.stack.imgur.com/4sWcg.jpg alt= alt text ></p> <p>The final step is to configure the Application Module to use the data source we created in the previous step. This is done as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Edit the application module.</li> <li>In the Navigator right-click the Business Components application module icon and choose Configurations.</li> <li>Select the appropriate configuration.</li> <li>Select this configuration and click Edit.</li> <li>In the Connection Type list choose JDBC DataSource.</li> <li>Enter a DataSource Name. For example: java:/OracleDS.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Deploy the ADF BC Module</strong><br> If you have your JBoss server either locally or mapped on your local machine you can deploy it directly from inside JDeveloper. If your JBoss server is remote and not mapped to the local machine or you have a JSP application that later will use this module you cannot deploy it directly from within JDeveloper. Both methods are described below.</p> <p><strong>Deploying the Module from within JDeveloper</strong><br> 1. Create a connection to the target application server. 2. If you want to support JBoss-specific configuration options for the EJB add a jboss.xml deployment descriptor file. For more information on this file see <a href= http://www.jboss.org rel= nofollow >http://www.jboss.org</a>. 3. If your project is a Business Components UIX JSP project add required Cabo resources to it. 4. Select the deployment profile in the Navigator right-click and choose Deploy to | &lt; application server connection> to package the application as an archive file and deploy it via the selected application server connection.</p> <p><strong>Deploying the Module outside of JDeveloper</strong><br> If your JBoss server is remote and not mapped to the local machine or you have a JSP application that later will use this module you will have to do as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Choose Deploy to EAR file from the context menu to deploy it as an EAR file. You must deploy this application to an EAR file and not a WAR file as JBoss will not add the EJB references under the java:comp/env/ JNDI namespace for a WAR file.</li> <li>Copy this file manually to the /deploy directory.</li> </ol>,

It is published by my company.</p> <p>Reading barcodes is extremely simple because the scanner simulates a keyboard. So you just have to scan instead of typing.

622204,,<p>I don't really see your problem. Clearly you're using C# which holds objects as references not instances. This means it's perfectly fine to have cross-referencing or even self-referencing. </p> <p>in C++ and other languages where objects are more compositied then you can have problems which are typically solved using references or pointers but C# should be fine.</p> <p>More than likely your problem is that you're trying to follow all references somehow leading to a circular reference. LINQ uses lazy loading to address this issue. For instance LINQ won't load the Company or the Employee until you reference it. You just need to avoid following such references further than one level.</p> <p>However you can't really add two tables as each others foreign key otherwise you would never be able to delete any record since deleting an employee would require deleting the company first but you can't delete the company without deleting the employee. Typically in this case you would only use one as a real foreign key the other would simply be a psuedo-FK (that is one that is used as an FK but doesn't have constraints enabled). You have to decide which is the more important relationship. </p> <p>In the company example you would likely want to delete the employee but not the company so make the company->employee FK the constraint relationship. This prevents you from deleting the company if there are employees but you can delete employees without deleting the company.</p> <p>Also avoid creating new objects in the constructor in these situations. For instance if your Employee object creates a new Company object which includes a new employee ojbect created for the employee it will eventually exhaust memory. Instead pass the objects already created to the constructor or set them after construction possibly by using an initalization method.</p> <p>For instance:</p> <pre><code>Company c = GetCompany( ACME Widgets ); c.AddEmployee(new Employee( Bill )); </code></pre> <p>then in AddEmployee you set the company</p> <pre><code>public void AddEmployee(Employee e) { Employees.Add(e); e.Company = this; } </code></pre>,

4403257,,<blockquote> <p>What is the difference between ValidatorForm and DynaValidatorForm?</p> </blockquote> <p>The answer to this is in fact the difference between ActionForm and DynaActionForm.</p> <p>In Struts everybody knows the <a href= http://struts.apache.org/1.2.7/api/org/apache/struts/action/ActionForm.html rel= nofollow >ActionForm</a> class (so I'm not gonna talk about it). But not everybody knows (or understands the purpose of - me included) the <a href= http://struts.apache.org/1.2.7/api/org/apache/struts/action/DynaActionForm.html rel= nofollow >DynaActionForm</a>. </p> <p>The idea behind DynaActionForms is that instead of creating a form class for each HTML form you instead configure one (you declare their properties types and defaults in the struts-config.xml file). It was supposed to be Dyna mic you know... but turned out to be some thing that nobody understood or used and presented some major disadvantages:</p> <ul> <li>they act sort of like a Map so it has the same problems of maps like retrieving data from it you know as an Object which you then have to cast. So you have casts everywhere;</li> <li>compiler no longer notifies you when you screw something up like a name of a property for example so compile errors turn into runtime errors;</li> <li>the things are not really dynamic since you still have to restart the server after you reconfigured the properties in the struts-config.xml file (or else modifications won't be picked up);</li> <li>code completion does not work on DynaActionForms type safety sucks (we are not taking generics here) and there are other nuisances that I can't remember right now.</li> </ul> <p>Well... the idea is that from a Struts point of view you have two main types of forms to deal with: ActionForm and DynaActionForm (even if the DynaActionForm is in fact a subclass of ActionForm).</p> <p>But you also have the <a href= http://struts.apache.org/1.2.4/userGuide/dev_validator.html rel= nofollow >validator plugin</a> where you place your validation rules in an external file and make them pick up by your action forms. You hook up the validator plugin by using a child of ActionForm: the ValidatorForm. And since you have two types of forms you must hook up the validator plugin for the DynaActionForms also: enter the DynaValidatorForm.</p> <p>In conclusion the ValidatorForm and DynaValidatorForm are the same thing but applied to different beasts .</p>,

296726,,<p>Not really an answer but why you need it at all? You need to sanitize HTML input only if you are going to output it without modifications i.e. if you want to allow your users actually to be able to use HTML. And if you want that you do not have to detect HTML you just need to make sure that you handle it safe. Jeff Atwood has a good <a href= http://refactormycode.com/codes/333-sanitize-html rel= nofollow >routine</a> for this.</p> <p>If you want to prevent at all HTML output you can take whatever the user inputs without any checks.

673767,,<p>While implementing a specialized memcache server for a certain datatype storage backend would be more memory efficient and lookup time could be decreased by bit wise lookup operations (<em>i.e: O(1) lookups</em>).</p> <p>I wrote all the protocol implementation and event driven daemon part with Python within 2 days giving us enough time to test on functionality and focusing on performance while team was validating protocol conformance and other bits. </p> <p>Given the the tools like <a href= http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/ rel= nofollow >Pyrex</a> implementing C extensions for Python is next to trivial for any developer a bit experienced in C. I rewrote the <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree rel= nofollow >Radix Tree</a> based storage backend in C and made it a Python module with Pyrex within a day. Memory usage for 475K prefixes went down from 90MB to 8MB.

Without Python and Pyrex it would take longer.</p> <p>We could have troubleshoot the performance problem by just using more powerful servers and switch to a multiprocess/multi-instance model while complicating the code and administration tasks accompanied with much larger memory footprint. </p> <p>I think you're on the right track to go with Python.</p>,

679362,,<p>The next thread to unblock on it's <code>sem_wait()</code> will be whatever thread the OS decides is the next one to context switch into. Nobody makes any guarantee of ordering; it depends on your OS's scheduling strategy. It might be the thread that has been off the CPU for the longest or the one that has been assigned the highest priority  or the one that has historically had certain resource-usage statistics or whatever.</p> <p>Most likely your current thread (the one that called <code>sem_post()</code>) will continue running for a while until it either starts waiting for user input blocks on another semaphore or runs out of its os-allotted time slice. Then the OS will switch in some totally unrelated process to run for a fraction of a second (probably Firefox or something) then go off and handle some network traffic get itself a cup of tea and finally when it gets around to it pick whichever of your other threads it feels like based on something like whether it feels based on past history that the particular thread is more CPU or I/O-bound.</p> <p>In many OSes priority is given to I/O-bound processes that haven't been around for very long. The theory is that new processes might be short-lived (if it's been around for five hours already odds are it won't be finishing up in the next 1ms) so we might as well get them over with. I/O-bound processes are likely to continue to be I/O-bound which means that chances are they are going to switch off the CPU shortly while waiting for other resources. Basically the OS wants to find the process that it's going to be able to be done with ASAP so it can get back to sipping its tea and running your malware.</p>,

351894,,<p>Fragmentation is not always invisible to all upper layers. Some early (and probably even current) micro-controller TCP/IP stacks did not implement the full capabilities such as fragmentation handling. Use of the flag in that situation would ensure that the packet arrived in its original form instead of a lot of fragments which the other end couldn't handle.</p> <p>In addition when using UDP it's not necessary for all the fragments to arrive at the destination so preventing fragmentation means the message either arrives or doesn't arrive - there is no possibility that only a bit of the UDP datagram will reach the destination. I can't recall how long the TCP/IP stack held on to unassembled IP packets waiting for missing fragments but use of the DF flag meant there were no unnecessary resources tied up during that time.</p> <p>Finally you can use it for testing behavior of network infrastructure such as what happens when you get a packet that's bigger than the maximum transmission unit (DF will prevent that packet from being fragmented to 'squeeze through' the hole).</p>,
138064,,<p>Neither model 1 nor model 2 will be loadable at run time unless they're well-formed — that is unless the <code>toBar</code> and <code>toFoo</code> relationships have destinations. Furthermore if model 1 and model 2 have identically-named models you won't be able to create a merged model from them; they will not be coalesced they will collide which is an error.</p> <p>However you can use the <code>NSManagedObjectModel</code> API manually to load each model and create a new model by hand that contains entities from both. The <code>NSEntityDescription</code> and <code>NSPropertyDescription</code> classes (and its subclasses) do implement the <code>NSCopying</code> protocol so in most cases you should just be able to copy properties over from each component model to your overall model.</p> <p>Furthermore the <code>NS*Description</code> classes all support a <code>userInfo</code> dictionary that you can edit in Xcode's data modeling tool which you can use to do things like tag the destination of a relationship as a stand-in. For example in model 1 you could have a <code>Bar</code> entity with a <code>userInfo</code> key <code>MyRealEntity</code> and check for that when creating your merged model as a signal to use the real entity instead.</p> <p>You'll also want to put stand-in inverse relationships to your stand-in entities; these will be replaced with real inverses after merging. You don't have to totally replicate your stand-in entities in all models though; you only need the inverse relationships used in your real model in a stand in entity.</p> <p>Thus if your real <code>Foo</code> has a <code>name</code> attribute and your real Bar has a <code>kind</code> attribute your stand-in <code>Foo</code> and <code>Bar</code> won't need those just stand-in <code>toBar</code> and <code>toFoo</code> relationships.</p> <p>Here's some code demonstrating what I'm talking about:</p> <pre><code>- (NSManagedObjectModel *)mergeModelsReplacingDuplicates:(NSArray *)models { NSManagedObjectModel *mergedModel = [[[NSManagedObjectModel alloc] init] autorelease]; // General strategy: For each model copy its non-placeholder entities // and add them to the merged model. Placeholder entities are identified // by a MyRealEntity key in their userInfo (which names their real entity // though their mere existence is sufficient for the merging). NSMutableArray *mergedModelEntities = [NSMutableArray arrayWithCapacity:0]; for (NSManagedObjectModel *model in models) { for (NSEntityDescription *entity in [model entities]) { if ([[entity userInfo] objectForKey:@ MyRealEntity ] == nil) { NSEntityDescription *newEntity = [entity copy]; [mergedModelEntities addObject:newEntity]; [newEntity release]; } else { // Ignore placeholder. } } } [mergedModel setEntities:mergedModelEntities]; return mergedModel; } </code></pre> <p>This works because copying of <code>NS*Description</code> objects in Core Data is by-name rather than by-value with respect to a relationship's destination entity and inverse (and to an entity's subentities as well). Thus while a model is mutable — that is before it's set as the model for an <code>NSPersistentStoreCoordinator</code> — you can use tricks like this to break your model into multiple models.</p>,

Full Trust would allow the application to control whatever it wants but only if the Application Pool process has sufficient rights to do it. So if you're running as a limited user with no rights on the server except what the applicaition needs then I suppose there's essentially no risk to Full Trust . The reality is that the app pool owner most likely has a number of rights you wouldn't want your app to have (and in some cases many many more) so it's much safer to limit app security and grant additional rights needs individually to the application. Thanks for the correction Barry.</p>,
